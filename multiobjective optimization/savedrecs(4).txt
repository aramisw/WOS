AB This letter presents an efficient particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm developed to design a near-field time-delay equalizer metasurface (TDEM) for the purpose of improving directivity and radiation patterns of classical electromagnetic band-gap resonator antennas. Triple layers of conductive printed patterns in the metasurface were optimized by the PSO algorithm to systematically design the TDEM. Predicted and measured results show a significant improvement in antenna performance including 9.6 dB enhancement in antenna directivity, lower sidelobes, and higher gain. The measured directivity of the prototype is 21 dBi, and 3-dB bandwidth is 11.8%.

AB The purpose of this paper is to provide efficient lightweight design for improving the loading carrying efficiency and energy absorption capability of tailor-rolled blank thin-walled structure with top-hat section (TRB-TH) under transverse loading. First, a new finite-element (FE) modelling method for the TRB-TH structure is proposed. The FE model is validated by performing quasi-static bending tests on two kinds of typical specimens. Second, the validated FE model is used to study the loading carrying efficiency and energy absorption capability of TRB-TH structures with variations in the thicknesses of constant thickness zone, lengths and positions of thickness transition zone by using global sensitivity analysis. Finally, to determine the optimal thickness distribution, multiobjective optimisation design is performed by integrating response surface method and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) algorithm. The results have demonstrated that the TRB-TH structures can not only produce much better Pareto solutions than the traditional designed uniform thickness (UF-TH) counterparts, but also provide a better balance between lightweight and crashworthiness of energy absorbers simultaneously. The proposed approach can provide some useful guidance for designing the TRB-TH energy absorbers of vehicle body.

AB Recent advancements in crashworthiness analysis of functionally graded foam-filled tubes are achieved by studying the energy absorption characteristics in lateral or axial directions, separately. In this paper, for the first time, two-directional (lateral and axial directions together) functionally graded foams (TDFGFs) under axial crushing loads are considered. The effect of variations of foam density on the specific energy absorption (SEA) and peak crushing force (PCF) is studied by controlling the gradient exponential parameters which give rise to significant effects on the crashworthiness of TDFGFs. Also, it is further analysed that how the mass of the TDFGF tube changes values of SEA in crushing process. In addition, as the result of performing multi-objective particle swarm optimisations, it is seen that the energy absorption characteristics of TDFGFs for higher values of gradient exponential parameters are improved significantly. The crashworthiness properties of optimum configurations for TDFGF are compared with the extreme cases of minimum, maximum densities and uniform foam-filled tubes with the same weight as the corresponding TDFGF tubes. Finally, a global sensitivity analysis is carried out. The results of this analysis reveal that the SEA and PCF functions are generally sensitive to the variations of the gradient exponential parameters.

AB Optimisation in changing environments is a challenging research topic since many real-world problems are inherently dynamic. Inspired by the natural evolution process, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are among the most successful and promising approaches that have addressed dynamic optimisation problems. However, managing the exploration/exploitation trade-off in EAs is still a prevalent issue, and this is due to the difficulties associated with the control and measurement of such a behaviour. The proposal of this paper is to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation in an explicit manner. The idea is to use two equally sized populations: the first one performs exploration while the second one is responsible for exploitation. These tasks are alternated from one generation to the next one in a regular pattern, so as to obtain a balanced search engine. Besides, we reinforce the ability of our algorithm to quickly adapt after cnhanges by means of a memory of past solutions. Such a combination aims to restrain the premature convergence, to broaden the search area, and to speed up the optimisation. We show through computational experiments, and based on a series of dynamic problems and many performance measures, that our approach improves the performance of EAs and outperforms competing algorithms.

AB This paper presents an optimal design approach of power system stabilizer (PSS) using multiobjective genetic algorithms. The PSS design is formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem which involves two conflicting performance criteria: the robustness and the transient performance of the closed-loop system. The proposed approach is applied to a single-machine infinite-bus system considering the conventional speed-based lead-lag PSS and a dual-input PSS which uses the accelerating power as an additional input. The optimization results show that trade-offs exist between the two objective functions of the problem resulting in a set of optimal solutions rather than a unique optimal solution. It is also found that the best trade-off according to Pareto dominance is provided by the dual-input PSS.

AB Purpose - This paper aims to present the optimal design of an inductor used to heat a magnetic nanoparticle fluid injected in a cell culture inside a Petri dish.
   Design/methodology/approach - The inductor design is driven by means of a multi-objective optimization algorithm that generalizes the migration-non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA); it is called self-adapting migration-NSGA.
   Findings - The optimized device is able to synthesize a uniform magnetic field in a nanoparticle fluid, substantially helping its heating capability. The ultimate scope is to assist the cancer therapy based on magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH).
   Originality/value - The optimal design of an inductor for MFH applications has been carried out by applying an improved version of migration-based NSGA-II algorithm including automatic stop and a self-adapting concept. The modified optimization algorithm is suitable to find better optimal solutions with respect to a standard version of NSGA-II.

AB Flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP) is an NP-hard puzzle which inherits the job-shop scheduling problem (JSP) characteristics. This paper presents a bee evolutionary guiding nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (BEG-NSGA-II) for multiobjective FJSP (MO-FJSP) with the objectives to minimize the maximal completion time, the workload of the most loaded machine, and the total workload of all machines. It adopts a two-stage optimization mechanism during the optimizing process. In the first stage, the NSGA-II algorithm with.. iteration times is first used to obtain the initial population.., in which a bee evolutionary guiding scheme is presented to exploit the solution space extensively. In the second stage, the NSGA-II algorithm with GEN iteration times is used again to obtain the Pareto-optimal solutions. In order to enhance the searching ability and avoid the premature convergence, an updating mechanism is employed in this stage. More specifically, its population consists of three parts, and each of them changes with the iteration times. What is more, numerical simulations are carried out which are based on some published benchmark instances. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed BEG-NSGA-II algorithm is shown by comparing the experimental results and the results of some well-known algorithms already existed.

AB We study a class of multiobjective bilevel programs with the weights of objectives being uncertain and assumed to belong to convex and compact set. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study about this class of problems. We use a worst-case weighted approach to solve this class of problems. Our "worst-case weighted multiobjective bilevel programs" model supposes that each player (leader or follower) has a set of weights to their objectives and wishes to minimize their maximum weighted sum objective where the maximization is with respect to the set of weights. This new model gives rise to a new Pareto optimum concept, which we call "robust-weighted Pareto optimum"; for the worst-case weighted multiobjective optimization with the weight set of each player given as a polytope, we show that a robust-weighted Pareto optimum can be obtained by solving mathematical programing with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). For an application, we illustrate the usefulness of the worst-case weighted multiobjective optimization to a supply chain risk management under demand uncertainty. By the comparison with the existing weighted approach, we show that our method is more robust and can be more efficiently applied to real- world problems.

AB In this paper the questions of the attractors' application in case of the development of the forecasting models on the base of the strictly binary trees have been considered. Usually, these models use the short time series as the training data sequence. The application of the principles of the attractors' forming on the base of the long time series will allow creating the training data sequence more reasonably. The offered approach to creation of the training data sequence for the forecasting models on the base of the strictly binary trees was applied for the individual and groups' forecasting of time series. At the same time the problems of one-objective and multiobjective optimization on the base of the modified clonal selection algorithm have been considered. The reviewed examples confirm the efficiency of the attractors' application in sense of minimization of the used quality indicators of the forecasting models, and also the forecasting errors on 1 - 5 steps forward. Besides, the minimization of time expenditures for the development of the forecasting models is provided.

AB The relief distributions after large disasters play an important role for rescue works. After disasters there is a high degree of uncertainty, such as the demands of disaster points and the damage of paths. The demands of affected points and the velocities between two points on the paths are uncertain in this article, and the robust optimization method is applied to deal with the uncertain parameters. This paper proposes a nonlinear location routing problem with half-time windows and with three objectives. The affected points can be visited more than one time. The goals are the total costs of the transportation, the satisfaction rates of disaster nodes, and the path transport capacities which are denoted by vehicle velocities. Finally, the genetic algorithm is applied to solve a number of numerical examples, and the results show that the genetic algorithm is very stable and effective for this problem.

TI Multiobjective Optimization Model for Wind Power Allocation

DT Article
ID CONSTRAINT METHOD; RESOURCES
AB There is an increasing need for the injection to the grid of renewable energy; therefore, to evaluate the optimal location of new renewable generation is an important task. The primary purpose of this work is to develop a multiobjective optimization model that permits finding multiple trade-off solutions for the location of new wind power resources. It is based on the augmented epsilon-constrained methodology. Two competitive objectives are considered: maximization of preexisting energy injection and maximization of new wind energy injection, both embedded, in the maximization of load supply. The results show that the location of new renewable generation units affects considerably the transmission network flows, the load supply, and the preexisting energy injection. Moreover, there are diverse opportunities to benefit the preexisting generation, contrarily to the expected effect where renewable generation displaces conventional power. The proposed methodology produces a diverse range of equivalent solutions, expanding and enriching the horizon of options and giving flexibility to the decision-making process.

AB Supply chain cooperation strategy believes that the integration of the operation process can produce value for customers, optimize the supply chain of the connection between the vertical nodes, and constantly strengthen the performance of the advantages, so as to achieve mutual benefit and win-win results. Under fuzzy uncertain environment and centralized decision-making mode, we study multiobjective decision-making optimization, which focuses on equilibrium and compensation of multiobjective problems; that is to say, the proper adjustment of the individual goal satisfaction level will make other goals' satisfaction levels change greatly. Through coordination among the multiobjectives, supply chain system will achieve global optimum. Finally, a simulation experiment from Shaoxing textile case is used to verify its efficiency and effectiveness.

ID CO2 EMISSIONS; INTENSITY; SCENARIO
AB China's energy issues and carbon emissions have become important global concerns. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the fulfillment of China's commitment to carbon emissions reduction by 2030. We establish the Markov chain model to analyze the transition of primary energy structure and carbon emissions in China by 2030 without artificial intervention and build three multiobjective optimization models to analyze China's energy structure and emissions reduction targets by 2030 under three scenarios (scenario of energy structure optimization, scenario of energy intensity optimization, and scenario of energy structure-intensity optimization). The findings show that the proportions of coal, oil, natural gas, and nonfossil energy will reach 17.89%, 11.52%, 49.43%, and 21.16%, respectively; the total decreases in CO2 intensity reach 43.11%, 61.78%, and 60.64%, respectively; the CO2 emissions under these three scenarios are 25.092, 16.859, and 17.359 billion tons. In other words, China's emissions reduction targets cannot be easily achieved. In order to keep pace with China's overall mitigation agenda, we put forward the policy recommendations. Through these analyses and discussions, we hope to make contributions to policy stimulation in energy, carbon emissions, and ecological protection.

AB Time-of-Use (TOU) electricity pricing provides an opportunity for industrial users to cut electricity costs. Although many methods for Economic Load Dispatch (ELD) under TOU pricing in continuous industrial processing have been proposed, there are still difficulties in batch-type processing, since power load units are not directly adjustable and nonlinearly depend on production planning and scheduling. In this paper, for hot rolling, a typical batch-type and energy intensive process in steel industry, a production scheduling optimization model for ELD is proposed under TOU pricing, in which the objective is to minimize electricity costs while considering penalties caused by jumps between adjacent slabs. A NSGA-II based multiobjective production scheduling algorithm is developed to obtain Pareto optimal solutions, and then TOPSIS based multicriteria decision-making is performed to recommend an optimal solution to facilitate field operation. Experimental results and analyses show that the proposed method cuts electricity costs in production, especially in case of allowance for penalty score increase in a certain range. Further analyses show that the proposed method has effect on peak load regulation of power grid.

ID MULTIOBJECTIVE EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM; DECOMPOSITION; HYPERVOLUME;
   REDUCTION
AB It is extremely important to maintain balance between convergence and diversity for many-objective evolutionary algorithms. Usually, original BBO algorithm can guarantee convergence to the optimal solution given enough generations, and the Biogeography/Complex (BBO/Complex) algorithm uses within-subsystem migration and cross-subsystem migration to preserve the convergence and diversity of the population. However, as the number of objectives increases, the performance of the algorithm decreases significantly. In this paper, a novel method to solve the many-objective optimization is called Hmp/BBO (Hybrid Metropolis Biogeography/Complex Based Optimization). The new decomposition method is adopted and the PBI function is put in place to improve the performance of the solution. On the within-subsystem migration the inferior migrated islands will not be chosen unless they pass the Metropolis criterion. With this restriction, a uniform distribution Pareto set can be obtained. In addition, through the above-mentioned method, algorithm running time is kept effectively. Experimental results on benchmark functions demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in comparison with five state-of-the-art designs in terms of both solutions to convergence and diversity.

AB The power loss in electrical power systems is an important issue. Many techniques are used to reduce active power losses in a power system where the controlling of reactive power is one of the methods for decreasing the losses in any power system. In this paper, an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm using eagle strategy (ESPSO) is proposed for solving reactive power optimization problem to minimize the power losses. All simulations and numerical analysis have been performed on IEEE 30-bus power system, IEEE 118-bus power system, and a real power distribution subsystem. Moreover, the proposed method is tested on some benchmark functions. Results obtained in this study are compared with commonly used algorithms: particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, genetic algorithm (GA), artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, firefly algorithm (FA), differential evolution (DE), and hybrid genetic algorithm with particle swarm optimization (hGAPSO). Results obtained in all simulations and analysis show that the proposed method is superior and more effective compared to the other methods.

AB For the problem of multiaircraft cooperative suppression interference array (MACSIA) against the enemy air defense radar network in electronic warfare mission planning, firstly, the concept of route planning security zone is proposed and the solution to get the minimum width of security zone based on mathematical morphology is put forward. Secondly, the minimum width of security zone and the sum of the distance between each jamming aircraft and the center of radar network are regarded as objective function, and the multiobjective optimization model of MACSIA is built, and then an improved multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to solve the model. The decomposition mechanism is adopted and the proportional distribution is used to maintain diversity of the new found nondominated solutions. Finally, the Pareto optimal solutions are analyzed by simulation, and the optimal MACSIA schemes of each jamming aircraft suppression against the enemy air defense radar network are obtained and verify that the built multiobjective optimization model is corrected. It also shows that the improved multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm for solving the problem of MACSIA is feasible and effective.

AB The paper studies the problem of scheduling a group of Earth remote sensing satellites. The following idea is proved: development of Earth remote sensing systems needs changing of approach to planning of their application. Problem statement is described. As criteria of efficiency, information delivery time, resolution and cost of request execution are used. The schedule has to comply with the following constraints: visibility between satellites, observation areas and data receiving points, storage capacity of the memory unit as well as coordination of operations on shooting, storing, transmitting and receiving data. Review of ways of problem solution is provided. Implementation of the approach has been suggested, where the sought schedule is built as dynamic balancing of interests of satellites, data receiving points and observation area agents. Multi-agent planning system is developed. Architecture of the system is described as well as functions of the modules it includes. Dynamically occurring events are taken into account when planning, including introduction of a new task or change of task options, failure of a satellite or means of communication. The experimental assessment of time spent on recovery of the damaged schedule is given. In conclusion benefits of the multi-agent approach at management of swarm of Earth remote sensing satellites are provided. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The optimum economic sizing of a water distribution network has been focus of study for many researches and projectors, and represent a relevant part of sanitation programs. But, by now, the known works approaches only the implantation cost, considering that the pipes have biggest heavy in the project. So, the problem is reduced to sizing pipes which objective is reach a cheaper network and satisfying the minimum hydraulic prerequisites. This leads to the choice of a network with pipes of minor diameters since this choice satisfies the hydraulics restrictions. New in Brazil by now, our approach consider too the maintenance cost throughout life span of network. It because, if in one way the larger diameters are more expensive, in an other, it are more resistant to break and to rugosity effects. This leads to a network of minimum maintenance cost throughout its life span. Then, we reach the equilibrium between the implantation cost and the maintenance cost.

AB Dynamic forces due to moving loads, especially during passages over bridges, have an even more significant effect on passenger comfort. In this study, a rail vehicle bogie with 10 degrees of freedom (DOF) and an Euler-Bernoulli beam bridge model were constructed in order to assess passenger comfort under moving loads. Bogie, and bridge and rail irregularities were coupled by superposition and the effect of rail vehicle velocity, wagon mass, and rail irregularity on passenger comfort were determined by means of frequency weighted acceleration values obtained through simulations performed with the Newmark-beta method. Using an interface integrated with the fuzzy logic expert system, the bogie suspension parameters were optimised according to vehicle velocity, wagon mass, and rail irregularities. The rail vehicle acceleration values resulting from the optimised suspension parameters and the suspension parameters reported in the literature were simulated and compared with one another; it was determined that the suspension parameters optimised by the fuzzy logic expert system resulted in an improvement in passenger comfort by over 34% at high velocities.

AB The shoring system that consists of soldier piles and anchor tiebacks is often used in deep excavations in sandy deposits. However, uncertainties often exist in the design of such shoring systems. In this article, a simplified-robust geotechnical design method is proposed to account for these uncertainties in the shoring system design. Specifically, for a given deep excavation, uncertain soil parameters and surcharges are treated as noise factors, and the parameters of soldier piles and tieback anchors are treated as design parameters. Robust design is then implemented as a multiobjective optimization problem, in which the design robustness is sought along with cost efficiency and safety requirements. A trade-off between design robustness and cost efficiency exists and the optimization usually leads to a Pareto front. By applying the knee point concept, the most preferred design that meets the safety requirements and yields the best compromise between design robustness and cost efficiency can be identified on the Pareto front. Improvements made to the existing robust geotechnical design method include an efficient formulation of the design robustness and a new procedure for finding the most preferred design in the design pool. The new simplified-robust geotechnical design method is illustrated with a real-world excavation case study.

AB A common strategy in Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is to rank alternative solutions by weighted summary scores. Weights, however, are often abstract to the decision maker and can only be set by vague intuition. While previous work supports a point-wise exploration of weight spaces, we argue that MCDM can benefit from a regional and global visual analysis of weight spaces. Our main contribution is WeightLifter, a novel interactive visualization technique for weight-based MCDM that facilitates the exploration of weight spaces with up to ten criteria. Our technique enables users to better understand the sensitivity of a decision to changes of weights, to efficiently localize weight regions where a given solution ranks high, and to filter out solutions which do not rank high enough for any plausible combination of weights. We provide a comprehensive requirement analysis for weight-based MCDM and describe an interactive workflow that meets these requirements. For evaluation, we describe a usage scenario of WeightLifter in automotive engineering and report qualitative feedback from users of a deployed version as well as preliminary feedback from decision makers in multiple domains. This feedback confirms that WeightLifter increases both the efficiency of weight-based MCDM and the awareness of uncertainty in the ultimate decisions.

AB Multi-target drugs against particular multiple targets get better protection, resistance profiles and curative influence by cooperative rules of a key beneficial target with resistance behavior and compensatory elements. Computational techniques can assist us in the efforts to design novel drugs (ligands) with a preferred bioactivity outline and alternative bioactive molecules at an early stage. A number of in silico methods have been explored extensively in order to facilitate the investigation of individual target agents and to propose a selective drug. A different, progressively more significant field which is used to predict the bioactivity of chemical compounds is the data mining method. Some of the previously mentioned methods have been investigated for multi-target drug design (MTDD) to find drug leads interact simultaneously with multiple targets. Several cheminformatics methods and structure-based approaches try to extract information from units working cooperatively in a biomolecular system to fulfill their task. To dominate the difficulties of the experimental specification of ligand-target structures, rational methods, namely molecular docking, SAR and QSAR are vital substitutes to obtain knowledge for each structure in atomic insight. These procedures are logically successful for the prediction of binding affinity and have shown promising potential in facilitating MTDD. Here, we review some of the important features of the multi-target therapeutics discoveries using the computational approach, highlighting the SAR, QSAR, docking and pharmacophore methods to discover interactions between drug-target that could be leveraged for curative benefits. A summary of each, followed by examples of its applications in drug design has been provided. Computational efficiency of each method has been represented according to its main strengths and limitations.

AB In this study, a dual loop ORC (organic Rankine cycle) system is adopted to recover exhaust energy, waste heat from the coolant system, and intercooler heat rejection of a six-cylinder CNG (compressed natural gas) engine. The thermodynamic, heat transfer, and optimization models for the dual loop ORC system are established. On the basis of the waste heat characteristics of the CNG engine over the whole operating range, a GA (genetic algorithm) is used to solve the Pareto solution for the thermodynamic and heat transfer performances to maximize net power output and minimize heat transfer area. Combined with optimization results, the optimal parameter regions of the dual loop ORC system are determined under various operating conditions. Then, the variation in the heat transfer area with the operating conditions of the CNG engine is analyzed. The results show that the optimal evaporation pressure and superheat degree of the HT (high temperature) cycle are mainly influenced by the operating conditions of the CNG engine. The optimal evaporation pressure and superheat degree of the HT cycle over the whole operating range are within 2.5-2.9 MPa and 0.43-12.35 K, respectively. The optimal condensation temperature of the HT cycle, evaporation and condensation temperatures of the LT (low temperature) cycle, and exhaust temperature at the outlet of evaporator 1 are kept nearly constant under various operating conditions of the CNG engine. The thermal efficiency of the dual loop ORC system is within the range of 8.79%-10.17%. The dual loop ORC system achieves the maximum net power output of 23.62 kW under the engine rated condition. In addition, the operating conditions of the CNG engine and the operating parameters of the dual loop ORC system significantly influence the heat transfer areas for each heat exchanger.

AB A large amount of energy is consumed in the liquefaction process of LNG and is normally disposed through heat exchange with seawater in the regasification process. In this study, a cascade Rankine cycle was optimized to recover the cold energy by applying a genetic algorithm. Gene population composed of chromosomes with various process parameters as geno types was created. Randomly created and combined chromosomes were restricted to conditions without any violation of the integrity of thermodynamic modeling. The process conditions that resulted in the maximum net produced power could be found by varying the process parameters. Ethane (C2) and propane (C3) were applied and compared as working fluids. In application of a single fluid, the C2C2 cycle showed higher maximum value than the C3C3 cycle. The C2C3 cycle showed the highest power generation among all cycles. LNG at -162 degrees C, 100 kPa is regasified to 10 degrees C, 6000 kPa NG, while sea water used as heat source enters at 15 degrees C, 100 kPa and exits at 10 degrees C, 300 kPa. In the regasification of 1 kg/s LNG mass flow rate, power generation performance was 96.3 kW in the C2C3 cycle and the first law efficiency was 11.1% at this condition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB How to predict building energy performance with low computational times and good reliability? The study answers this question by employing artificial neural networks (ANNs) to assess energy consumption and occupants' thermal comfort for any member of a building category. Two families of ANNs are generated: the first one addresses the existing building stock (as is), the second one addresses the renovated stock in presence of energy retrofit measures (ERMs). The ANNs are generated in MATLAB (R) by using the outcomes of EnergyPlus simulations as targets for networks' training and testing. A preliminary 'Simulation-based Large-scale sensitivity/uncertainty Analysis of Building Energy performance' (SLABE) is conducted to optimize the ANNs' generation. It allows to identify the networks' inputs and to properly select the ERMs. The developed ANNs can replace standard building performance simulation tools, thereby producing a substantial reduction of computational efforts and times. This can allow a wide diffusion of rigorous approaches for retrofit design, which are currently hampered by the excessive computational burden. As case study, office buildings built in South Italy during 1920-1970 are investigated. Comparing the ANNs' predictions with EnergyPlus targets, the regression coefficient is between 0.960 and 0.995 and the average relative error is between 2.0% and 11%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Approximate problems that scalarize and approximate a given multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) became an important and interesting area of research, given that, in general, are simpler and have weaker existence requirements than the original problem. Recently, necessary conditions for approximation of several types of efficiency for MOPs have been obtained through the use of an alternative theorem. In this paper, we use these results in order to extend them to sufficient conditions for approximate quasi (weak, proper) efficiency. For this, we use two scalarization techniques of Tchebycheff type. All the provided results are established without convexity assumptions.

AB A multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) with inequality and equality constraints is considered where the objective and inequality constraint functions are locally Lipschitz and equality constraint functions are di ff erentiable. Burachik and Rizvi [J. Optim. Theory Appl. 155, 477-491 (2012)] gave Guignard and generalized Abadie regularity conditions for a di ff erentiable programming problem and derived Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) type necessary optimality conditions. In this paper, we have defined the nonsmooth versions of Guignard and generalized Abadie regularity conditions given by Burachik and Rizvi and obtained KKT necessary optimality conditions for e ffi cient and weak e ffi cient solutions of (MOP). Further several constraint qualifications su ffi cient for the above newly defined constraint qualifications are introduced for (MOP) with no equality constraints. Relationships between them are presented and examples are constructed to support the results.

AB A priori incorporation of the decision maker's preferences is a crucial issue in many-objective evolutionary optimization. Some approaches characterize the best compromise solution of this problem through fuzzy outranking relations; however, they require the elicitation of a large number of parameters (weights and different thresholds). This paper proposes a novel metaheuristic-based optimization method to infer the model's parameters of a fuzzy relational system of preferences, based on a small number of judgments given by the decision maker. The results show a satisfactory rate of error when predicting new outcomes with the parameter values obtained by using small size reference sets.

AB Nowadays, it is believed that increasing product variety could help manufacturing companies to increase sales volumes and gain more profits. An effective way that has been widely employed in industry is to implement product family strategy based on a modular architecture, with which a large number of product variants can be quickly generated using combinations of different alternative modules or components. However, it is not easy for a company to decide what product variants should be selected and produced in order to maximise profits. This is not only about marketing strategy but also tightly associated with the companies' own uncertain manufacturing resource constraints. Therefore, in this paper, a fuzzy optimisation model is adopted for modelling the product variety selection problem based on an existing modular product family architecture while at the same time considering uncertain manufacturing resource constraints. The proposed method can help various manufacturing companies to select the best product variety under the uncertain market environment and limited manufacturing and supplying capacity. Finally, a hypothetical car's selection is presented as an example to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the method proposed in this paper.

AB In this article, an improved multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, which is based on decomposition (IMOEA/D) for multiobjective job shop scheduling problem, is proposed to solve multiple objectives job shop scheduling problems. Three minimisation objectives - the maximum completion time (makespan), the total flow time and the tardiness time are considered simultaneously. In the proposed algorithm, several prior rules are presented to construct the initial population with a high level of quality. Meanwhile, according to the contribution of each operator to the external archive, an adaptive mechanism is adopted to select corresponding operators to generate new solutions, which can accelerate convergence speed. Simulation results on the standard test instances show that IMOEA/D has a better convergence performance compared with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms based on Pareto dominance.

AB This paper presents an integrated decision support methodology for locating bank branches. The methodology is composed of two stages: problem structuring, and modeling. In the first stage, initially, a number of criteria are selected with the help of a detailed literature review and expert opinions. Subsequently, importance weights of these criteria for different types of bank branches are identified based on judgments of experts for pairwise comparison questions. At the modeling stage, considering the characteristics and importance of the criteria, a novel multiobjective mathematical programming model is proposed to find specific locations of bank branches. The proposed methodology is applied in locating branches of a Turkish bank. In order to test the validity of the results and robustness, a sensitivity analysis is conducted and the solutions are found to be robust.

AB In this paper, a many-objective hybrid real-code population-based incremental learning and differential evolution algorithm (MnRPBILDE) is proposed based on the concept of objective function space reduction. The method is then implemented on real engineering design problems. The topology, shape and sizing design of a simplified automotive floor-frame structure are formulated and used as test problems. A variety of well-established multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) including the original version of MnRPBILDE are employed to solve the test problems while the results are compared based on hypervolume and C indicators. The results indicate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the other MOEAs. The proposed algorithm is effective and efficient for many-objective optimisations of a car floor-frame structure.

SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS

ID HL-20; ENVIRONMENT
AB The development of a multidisciplinary design optimization framework for crew reentry vehicles is presented. A waverider design methodology is used as the basis for the parametric design technique, with required modifications (e.g., leading edge blunting and integration of a cylindrical payload volume representing the crew compartment) used to allow the generation of practical reentry configurations. In addition to the shape design code, aerodynamics analysis, mass estimating, and trajectory/aeroheating analyses are linked using a multiobjective genetic algorithm optimization process to maximize vehicle downrange, additional payload mass capability, and lift-to-drag ratio. Pareto fronts were generated for three different launch vehicle capabilities ranging from 12,000 to 26,000kg to orbit, and highlight the relationships between reentry vehicle payload mass, maximum lift-to-drag ratio, and downrange, as well as the fact that a medium-class or larger launch vehicle was required to meet the baseline mission payload mass requirement. Although the modifications necessary for the crew reentry vehicle mission resulted in a substantial reduction in lift-to-drag ratio relative to the idealized waveriders used in the design process, comparisons of several designs to the NASA HL-20 concept indicated that the waverider-derived design process can produce vehicles with an almost 30% improvement in maximum lift-to-drag ratio and the ability to carry additional payload mass on longer downrange trajectories.

AB A class of multiobjective semi-infinite optimization problems with inequality and equality constraints is considered where the objective and constraints functions are locally Lipschitz. We present necessary optimality conditions for weak efficient solutions of a nonsmooth multiobjective semi-infinite problem. Moreover, sufficient conditions of optimality are provided under assumptions of generalized convexity.

AB In this work, weak conjugate map, weak biconjugate map and weak subdifferential of a set-valued map are defined by using notions of supremum/infimum of a set and vectorial norm, and relationships among these notions are examined. Furthermore, necessary and sufficient conditions for weakly subdifferentiability of a set-valued map are given. It is proved that under some assumptions Lipschitz set-valued maps are weakly subdifferentiable. By using these notions a dual of unconstrained nonconvex vector optimization problems is constructed, and weak duality theorem is presented. Stability of primal problem is defined and it is proved that the stability of primal problem implies the strong duality. Furthermore, some stability conditions are presented. By using a special perturbation function weak Fenchel dual problem of constrained vector optimization problem is constructed and at the end, an example of a nonconvex constrained vector optimization problem which can not be solved by using Lagrange dual problem [25] but can be solved by using weak Fenchel dual problem is given.

AB A new approach to optimizing process parameters and tailor-making TiO2 nanoparticles in flame was presented, based on combined use of computational fluid dynamics coupling with population balance-Monte Carlo (CFD-PBMC), orthogonal test, and experimental analysis. First, the CFD-PBMC simulation was established for acquiring the spatio-temporal evolution of the distributions of size, surface area and crystalline phase of nanoparticles and the profiles of other environmental variables. Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations accompanied by k - epsilon turbulence model and species transport-eddy dissipation model were solved to obtain the flow fields of flame, whereby temperature and flow velocity as environment variables were used for PBMC simulation. Four critical particle dynamic events, nucleation, agglomeration, sintering and phase transformation, were included in PBMC for the first time, thereinto the phase transformation was well described by a stochastic un-reacted-core shrinking model, depending on exploratory analysis modeling, to obtain the content of anatase and rutile in each TiO2 nanoparticle. The CFD-PBMC simulation results for three typical TiO2-seeded flames are generally consistent with experimental results measured by the dual time-interval thermophoretic sampling (DTTS) method. Later, a standard L-9 (4(3)) orthogonal table including nine representative simulation schemes was implemented to look for the best process parameter for desired rutile content (>95 wt%) and particle size (<50 nm) of TiO2 product. The optimized design scheme was obtained after range analysis. Finally, experiments were carried out to evaluate the optimized prediction. The results show that an almost pure rutile product with the equivalent primary particle diameter 23.5 nm was attained at the optimized condition. This research not only provides an effective way to simulate the dynamic process of flame synthesized nanoparticles, but also has realized controllable synthesis and tailor-making via multiobjective optimization design of nanomaterials.

AB Friction stir processing is a novel material processing technique. In this study, neural network-based genetic optimization is applied to optimize the process performance in terms of post-friction stir processing mechanical properties of Al7075 alloy and the energy cost. At first, the experimental data regarding the properties (i.e. elongation, tensile strength and hardness) and the consumed electrical energy are obtained by conducting tests varying two process parameters, namely, feed rate and spindle speed. Then, a numerical model making use of empirical data and artificial neural networks is developed, and multiobjective multivariable genetic optimization is applied to find a trade-off among the performance measures of friction stir processing. For this purpose, the properties like elongation, tensile strength and hardness are maximized and the cost of consumed electrical energy is minimized. Finally, the optimization results are verified by conducting experiments. It is concluded that artificial neural network together with genetic algorithm can be successfully employed to optimize the performance of friction stir processing.

AB In Design by Shopping, designers explore the design space to gain an insight into trades, and feasible and impractical solutions, as well as to learn about alternatives before optimization and selection. The design space consists of multidimensional sets of data and, in order to select the best design from among numerous alternatives, designers may use several different graphs. In this study, we test to find the most appropriate graph to indicate the best solution corresponding to a set of objectives represented by a design scenario (1). A further constraint is that this must be done in the shortest possible time (2). Three graph types are tested in three different design scenarios where one car has to be chosen from a total of 40. A response quality index is proposed which computes the quality of a designer's choice for any given scenario. In total, 90 tests with 30 participants were performed. The parallel coordinates plot proved to be the best graph for selection in Design by Shopping.

AB Solid state recycling through hot extrusion is a promising technique to recycle machining chips without remelting. Furthermore, equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) technique coupledwith the extruded recycled billet is introduced to enhance the mechanical properties of recycled samples. In this paper, the surface roughness of solid state recycled aluminum alloy 6061 turning chips was investigated. Aluminum chips were cold compacted and hot extruded under an extrusion ratio (ER) of 5.2 at an extrusion temperature (ET) of 425 degrees C. In order to improve the properties of the extruded samples, they were subjected to ECAP up to three passes at roomtemperature using an ECAP die with a channel die angle (Phi) of 90 degrees. Surface roughness (R-a and R-z) of the processed recycled billetsmachined by turning was investigated. Box- Behnken experimental design was used to investigate the effect of three machining parameters (cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut) on the surface roughness of the machined specimens for four materials conditions, namely, extruded billet and postextrusion ECAP processed billets to one, two, and three passes. Quadratic models were developed to relate the machining parameters to surface roughness, and a multiobjective optimization scheme was conducted to maximize material removal rate while maintaining the roughness below a preset practical value.

AB This paper deals with the optimal planning of vaccination campaigns, using an evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm and a stochastic simulation of the epidemics dynamics in order to determine robust vaccination policies. A biobjective model is formulated, considering the minimization of control costs and number of infected individuals. The decision variables include number of campaigns, percentage of vaccination and time interval between each campaign. A SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model and an IBM (Individual-Based Model) are employed for representing the epidemics. A two-stage optimization process is proposed: a set of nondominated steady-state regimes is obtained and one of them is selected to be concatenated to the transient regime vaccination policies. An evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm is proposed, with a local search procedure based on quadratic approximation supported by a hash table information storage. The resulting nondominated solutions are simulated in the IBM, in order to detect and discard the non-robust solutions. Final results show that optimal robust vaccination campaigns with different trade-offs can be designed, allowing policymakers to choose the best strategy according to the monetary cost and the expected efficacy.

AB Water treatment plants (WTPs) are tasked with providing safe potable water to consumers. However, WTPs face numerous potential obstacles, including changes in source water quality and quantity, financial burdens related to operations and upgrades, and stringent water quality regulations. Moreover, these challenges may be exacerbated by climate change in the form of long-term climatic perturbations and the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. To help WTPs overcome these issues, decision support systems (DSSs), which are used to aid and enhance the quality and consistency of decision-making, have been developed. This paper reviews the scientific literature on the development and application of DSSs for water treatment, including physically-based models, statistical models, and artificial intelligence techniques, and suggests future directions in the field. We first set the context of how water quality is impacted by climate change and extreme weather events. We then provide a comprehensive review of DSSs and conclude by offering a series of recommendations for future DSS efforts for WTPs, suggesting that these tools should (1) more accurately reflect the practical needs of WTPs, (2) represent the tradeoffs between the multiple competing objectives inherent to water treatment, (3) explicitly handle uncertainty to better inform decision makers, (4) incorporate nonstationarity, especially with regard to extreme weather events and climate change for long-term planning, and (5) use standardized terminology to accelerate the dissemination of knowledge in the field.

AB Usually, allocation of resources is an optimization problem which involves a variety of conflicting economic, social, and ecological objectives. In such a process, advanced geographic analyst tool for manipulation of spatial data and satisfaction of multiple objectives is essential to the success of decision-making. The present research intends to demonstrate the application of a multiobjective optimization method based on NSGA-II (we call it HNSGA-II), along with Geographical Information System (GIS) to select suitable sites for the establishment of large industrial units. Having defined the elements of HNSGA-II for the site selection of industrial units, the method is tested on the data of Zanjan province, Iran, as the case study. The results showed that the proposed approach can easily find a variety of optimized solutions, giving the decision-makers the possibility to opt for the most propitious solution. Using this method, the achievement level regarding each objective function can be studied for any of the nondominated solutions.

However, such multi-objective optimisation is often concerned with high-dimensional optimisation problems and the obtained Pareto optimal points are non-single, hence it is relatively complex and difficult to obtain a definite result in the design of PM machine. In this study, a comprehensive multi-objective scalarisation optimisation approach with the correlation parameters stratified method is proposed, where not only the impacts of each design parameter on objectives are investigated, but also the interactions among the design parameters themselves are considered and analysed in detail. In addition, by introducing the weight factors of the desired objectives, the multi-objective optimisation is transformed into a simplified scalar optimisation problem. Then, an interior PM machine with L-shaped PMs is investigated by using the proposed method. Finally, based on the optimised result, a prototype machine is built and tested. Both simulation and experiment results verify the validity of the proposed method.

AB In order to improve the power generation performance of a doubly salient permanent magnet generator (DSPMG), this study proposes a new converter called capacitive energy recovery converter (CERC), together with the corresponding control strategy. The CERC is composed of controllable devices, uncontrollable devices, and an energy storage circuit. The control strategy has been designed based on analysis of the electromagnetic characteristics of the DSPMG. With the proposed control strategy, the winding current of each phase can be controlled and increased separately, thus yielding large negative electromagnetic torque against the prime mover in a complete electric cycle. At the same time, the excitation sources are independent of the load part. As a result, power generation performance of the DSPMG with CERC is improved compared to that with a traditional three-phase full-bridge converter. A multi-objective optimisation problem is formulated to find the optimal turn-on and turn-off angles of two systems, which are used as control parameters in this comparison. Besides the lower voltage and torque ripples, the dynamic and fault-tolerant performance of the DSPMG with CERC is also superior. Both simulations and experiments have been conducted to verify the validity of the proposed converter and the control strategy.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM; ALLOCATION; SELECTION
AB The weapon-target assignment (WTA) problem, known as an NP-complete problem, aims at seeking a proper assignment of weapons to targets. The biobjective WTA (BOWTA) optimization model which maximizes the expected damage of the enemy and minimizes the cost of missiles is designed in this paper. A modified Pareto ant colony optimization (MPACO) algorithm is used to solve the BOWTA problem. In order to avoid defects in traditional optimization algorithms and obtain a set of Pareto solutions efficiently, MPACO algorithm based on new designed operators is proposed, including a dynamic heuristic information calculation approach, an improved movement probability rule, a dynamic evaporation rate strategy, a global updating rule of pheromone, and a boundary symmetric mutation strategy. In order to simulate real air combat, the pilot operation factor is introduced into the BOWTA model. Finally, we apply the MPACO algorithm and other algorithms to the model and compare the data. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is successfully applied in the field of WTA which improves the performance of the traditional P-ACO algorithm effectively and produces better solutions than the two well-known multiobjective optimization algorithms NSGA-II and SPEA-II.

AB An evolution strategy, approximating a single Pareto-optimal solution in an objective space exhibiting more than two objectives, is proposed as a cost-effective method (individual-based approach). Moreover, a standard NSGA-II code is modified in order to control the spread-out of unfeasible solutions in a three-dimensional objective space (population-based approach). Both methods are validated by means of a case study, i.e. the optimal design of a magnetic micro-switch.

AB Portfolio optimization problems involve selection of different assets to invest in order to maximize the overall return and minimize the overall risk simultaneously. The complexity of the optimal asset allocation problem increases with an increase in the number of assets available to select from for investing. The optimization problem becomes computationally challenging when there are more than a few hundreds of assets to select from. To reduce the complexity of large-scale portfolio optimization, two asset preselection procedures that consider return and risk of individual asset and pairwise correlation to remove assets that may not potentially be selected into any portfolio are proposed in this paper. With these asset preselection methods, the number of assets considered to be included in a portfolio can be increased to thousands. To test the effectiveness of the proposed methods, a NormalizedMultiobjective Evolutionary Algorithmbased onDecomposition (NMOEA/D) algorithmand several other commonly usedmultiobjective evolutionary algorithms are applied and compared. Six experiments with different settings are carried out. The experimental results show that with the proposed methods the simulation time is reduced while return-risk trade-off performances are significantly improved. Meanwhile, the NMOEA/D is able to outperform other compared algorithms on all experiments according to the comparative analysis.

AB Freshness of products and timeliness of delivery are two critical factors which have impact on customer satisfaction in terminal delivery of perishable products. This paper investigates how to make a cost-saving vehicle scheduling for perishable products by maximizing customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is defined from the two aspects of freshness and time window. Then we develop a priority function based on customer satisfaction and use the hierarchical clustering method to identify customer service priority. Based on the priority, amultiobjective vehicle scheduling optimization model for perishable products is formulated to maximize customer satisfaction and minimize total delivery costs. To solve the proposed model, a priority-based genetic algorithm (PB-GA) is designed. Numerical experiments and sensitivity analysis are performed to show the validity and advantage of our approach. Results indicate that PB-GA can achieve better solutions than traditional genetic algorithm. The improvement of customer satisfaction is higher than the decrease rate of total costs within a certain shelf life range, which reveals that the proposed method is applicable to the terminal delivery of perishable products.

We give a detailed description of the algorithm and illustrate its working in 2 different de novo design settings: the design of putative dual and selective FGFR and VEGFR inhibitors, and the successful design of organic structure determining agents (OSDAs) for the synthesis of zeolites. We show that the introduction of Pareto sorting not only enables the simultaneous optimization of multiple properties but also greatly improves the performance of the algorithm to generate molecules with hard-to-meet constraints. This in turn allows us to suggest approaches to address the problem of false positive hits in de novo structure based drug design by introducing structural and physicochemical constraints in the designed molecules, and by forcing essential interactions between these molecules and their target receptor.

For the uncertainty map being set-valued, a Taylor formula is shown under appropriate assumptions. The hard uncertainties are modeled using parametric set optimization problems for which a scalarization result is given. The presented new approach for the solution of multiobjective optimization problems with hard uncertainties is then applied to the layout optimization of photovoltaic power plants. Since good weather forecasts are difficult to obtain for future years, weather data are really hard uncertainties arising in the planning process. Numerical results are presented for a real-world problem on the Galapagos island Isabela.

AB In this paper, proper minimal elements of a given nonconvex set in a real ordered Banach space are defined utilizing the limiting (Mordukhovich) normal cone. The newly defined points are called limiting proper minimal (LPM) points. It is proved that each LPM is a proper minimal in the sense of Borwein under some assumptions. The converse holds in Asplund spaces. The relation of LPM points with Benson, Henig, super and proximal proper minimal points are established. Under appropriate assumptions, it is proved that the set of robust elements is a subset of the set of LPM points, and the set of LPM points is dense in that of minimal points. Another part of the paper is devoted to scalarization-based and distance function-based characterizations of the LPM points. The paper is closed by some results about LPM solutions of a set-valued optimization problem via variational analysis tools. Clarifying examples are given in addition to the theoretical results.

AB Environmental planning for of the maintenance of different conservation objectives should take into account multiple contrasting criteria based on alternative uses of the landscape. We develop new concepts and approaches to describe and measure conflicts among conservation objectives and for resolving them via multiobjective optimization. To measure conflicts we introduce a compatibility index that quantifies how much targeting a certain conservation objective affects the capacity of the landscape for providing another objective. To resolve such conflicts we find compromise solutions defined in terms of minimax regret, i.e. minimizing the maximum percentage of deterioration among conservation objectives. Finally, we apply our approach for a case study of management for biodiversity conservation and development in a forest landscape. We study conflicts between six different forest species, and we identify management solutions for simultaneously maintaining multiple species' habitat while obtaining timber harvest revenues. We employ the method for resolving conflicts at a large landscape level across a long 50-years forest planning horizon. Our multiobjective approach can be an instrument for guiding hard choices in the conservation-development nexus with a perspective of developing decision support tools for land use planning. In our case study multiple use management and careful landscape level planning using our approach can reduce conflicts among biodiversity objectives and offer room for synergies in forest ecosystems.

AB This paper presents a multiobjective optimization methodology to optimally place a STATCOM in electric power distribution networks. The combination of multiobjective ant colony optimization (MACO) and the bacterial foraging optimization algorithm (BFOA) is proposed to minimize the power loss and total cost. The main intention of this analysis is to optimally place the STATCOM at multiple locations such as the transmission side, middle, and load side. Identifying the type and location of the STATCOM is a combinatorial optimization problem in power systems. In order to overcome this problem, the combination of hybrid MACO and BFOA algorithms is applied in this analysis to minimize the total cost and power loss. The total cost of the overall network is calculated by using system average interruption duration index and system average interruption frequency index metrics. Moreover, the BFOA is used in this paper to minimize the power loss during distribution, which is adequate in searching for the optimal solution. The problem of reducing power losses in distribution systems through the BFOA approach is described here for a 5-bus system. Test results of a 5-bus network show that the proposed MACO with BFOA method can efficiently ensure the power loss and total cost minimization.

AB Reservoir construction changes a river's natural flows and temperature, thereby threatening fish migration. Researchers have tried to restore fish migration passages by ensuring environmental flows in downstream river channels. However, reservoir impoundment changes upstream environments from lotic to lentic and thereby hinders fish migration by eliminating migration cues, which has been rarely considered. This study characterized the invisible barriers that large reservoirs create for migratory fish. Water currents are the primary orientation cues for migration due to fish's natural rheotactic tendency. Fish also require suitable temperatures during migration. We built a quasi-3-D model to simulate hydrodynamic and temperature conditions in large reservoirs and tested whether these conditions met the velocity and temperature requirements of fish. Due to the strong effects of operation on reservoir conditions, we proposed an eco-friendly technical operating solution to restore migration passages. We added an ecological constraint (i.e., creating a suitable velocity field for fish migration) to reservoir operation model and applied multiobjective optimization to simultaneously protect reservoir benefits. As a case, we applied our approach to China's Danjiangkou Reservoir. We found that velocities in more than half of the zones along the potential fish migration route through the reservoir were lower than the fish requirement and could not offer orientation cues for migration. The eco-friendly operating scheme effectively restored a fish migration passage by managing reservoir releases during key migration periods, slightly reducing the reservoir's socioeconomic benefits by 1.67-5.03%. This study provides a new perspective on biodiversity and fisheries protection in global regulated rivers.

AB In this paper a new multi-objective clonal selection algorithm (theta-MCSA) is presented to solve multi-objective problems with multimodal and non-continuous functions. The concept of clonal selection algorithm (CSA) is based on the immune system and white blood cells behavior that select the antibodies similar to antigen for cloning. Although the clonal selection is a robust optimization method, however, as a shortcoming, it takes long time to find optimal Pareto front especially in problems with large search space. To overcome this problem, the proposed method replaces the large search space with the theta-search based on the phase angles. To avoid trapping into local optima in mutation step, two strong mutation methods are implemented according to the iteration number and algorithm efficiency. For converging to uniformly Pareto front in less iterations, the proposed multi-objective algorithm handles the size of the repository and a new population updating mechanism is iteratively applied to select the non-dominate, one-dominate and two-dominate solutions of prior iteration. The experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed theta-MCSA algorithm compared to other methods.

AB In this paper, an adaptive fuzzy controller design methodology via MultiObjective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) based on robust stability criterion, is proposed. The plant to be controlled is modeled from its input-output experimental data considering a Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy NARX model, by using the fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm (antecedent parameters estimation) and Weighted Recursive Least Squares (WRLS) algorithm (consequent parameters estimation). An adaptation mechanism as MOPSO problem for online tuning of a fuzzy model based digital PID controller parameters, based on the gain and phase margins specifications, is formulated. Experimental results for adaptive fuzzy digital PID control of a thermal plant with time varying delay is presented to illustrate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed methodology.

The multiobjective model is composed by two objective functions, in which the transportation and inventory cost are optimized using the Inventory Routing Problem (IRP) and the service level is optimized using the number of accomplished time windows for the vehicles in the routing process. The model is solved using the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGAII), implementing a novel representation of the chromosome, which allows assigning inventory and routes simultaneously. The algorithm allows calculating the Pareto Frontier for the analyzed distribution case, observing good qualities in the solution, compared with what is found in scientific literature.

AB The optimal design of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) can be formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem that spreads over multiple levels (technology, topology, size, and control). In the last decade, studies have shown that by integrating these optimization levels, fuel benefits are obtained, which go beyond the results achieved with solely optimal control for a given topology. Due to the large number of variables for optimization, their diversity, and the nonlinear and multiobjective nature of the problem, a variety of methodologies have been developed. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the various methodologies developed and identifies challenges for future research. Starting from a general description of the problem, with examples found in the literature, we categorize the types of optimization problems and methods used. To offer a complete analysis, we broaden the scope of the search to several sectors of transport, such as naval or ground.

AB Corticospinal neurons (SPI), thick-tufted pyramidal neurons in motor cortex layer 5B that project caudally via the medullary pyramids, display distinct class-specific electrophysiological properties in vitro: strong sag with hyperpolarization, lack of adaptation, and a nearly linear frequency-current (F-I) relationship. We used our electrophysiological data to produce a pair of large archives of SPI neuron computer models in two model classes: 1) detailed models with full reconstruction; and 2) simplified models with six compartments. We used a PRAXIS and an evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) in sequence to determine ion channel conductances. EMO selected good models from each of the two model classes to form the two model archives. Archived models showed tradeoffs across fitness functions. For example, parameters that produced excellent F-I fit produced a less-optimal fit for interspike voltage trajectory. Because of these tradeoffs, there was no single best model but rather models that would be best for particular usages for either single neuron or network explorations. Further exploration of exemplar models with strong F-I fit demonstrated that both the detailed and simple models produced excellent matches to the experimental data. Although dendritic ion identities and densities cannot yet be fully determined experimentally, we explored the consequences of a demonstrated proximal to distal density gradient of I h, demonstrating that this would lead to a gradient of resonance properties with increased resonant frequencies more distally. We suggest that this dynamical feature could serve to make the cell particularly responsive to major frequency bands that differ by cortical layer.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY We developed models of motor cortex corticospinal neurons that replicate in vitro dynamics, including hyperpolarization-induced sag and realistic firing patterns. Models demonstrated resonance in response to synaptic stimulation, with resonance frequency increasing in apical dendrites with increasing distance from soma, matching the increasing oscillation frequencies spanning deep to superficial cortical layers. This gradient may enable specific corticospinal neuron dendrites to entrain to relevant oscillations in different cortical layers, contributing to appropriate motor output commands.

AB Energy management in rural area is a challenging issue for sustainable agriculture. A large number of livestock farms including dairy and poultry farms are the major cause of environmental pollution due to improper handling of animal and broiler wastes. The appropriate use of waste material not only reduces the environmental pollution but also serves as an additional source of electricity. In this article, efficient energy management model is developed to ensure uninterrupted supply of energy and also minimize the environmental impacts and cost of electricity to consumers by using multiobjective optimization. In the proposed scheme, electricity is supposed to be generated through biogas generation from waste materials of animals and broilers. In addition, electricity will also be reserved from solar, utility and diesel resources to ensure continuous supply of electricity to the consumers. Multiple sources of energy are being used to handle the intermittent nature of renewable resources and unpredicted electricity load shedding. The proposed multiobjective optimization is binary integer linear programming problem in which objective and constraints take binary and integer values. Branch and bound algorithm is incorporated to solve this multiobjective optimization problem. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB In order to improve utilization rate of high dimensional data features, an ensemble learning method based on feature selection for entity resolution is developed. Entity resolution is regarded as a binary classification problem, an optimization model is designed to maximize each classifier's classification accuracy and dissimilarity between classifiers and minimize cardinality of features. A modified multiobjective ant colony optimization algorithm is employed to solve the model for each base classifier, two pheromone matrices are set up, weighted product method is applied to aggregate values of two pheromone matrices, and feature's Fisher discriminant rate of records' similarity vector is calculated as heuristic information. A solution which is called complementary subset is selected from Pareto archive according to the descending order of three objectives to train the given base classifier. After training all base classifiers, their classification outputs are aggregated by max-wins voting method to obtain the ensemble classifiers' final result. A simulation experiment is carried out on three classical datasets. The results show the effectiveness of our method, as well as a better performance compared with the other two methods.

AB Affective responses concern customers' affective needs and have received increasing attention in consumer-focused research. To design a product that appeals to consumers, designers should consider multiple affective responses (MARs). Designing products capable of satisfyingMARs falls into the category ofmultiobjective optimization (MOO). However, when exploring optimal product form design, most relevant studies have transformed multiple objectives into a single objective, which limits their usefulness to designers and consumers. To optimize product form design for MARs, this paper proposes an integrated model based on MOO andmulticriteria decision-making (MCDM). First, design analysis is applied to identify design variables andMARs; quantification theory type I is then employed to build the relationship models between them; on the basis of these models, an MOO model for optimization of product form design is constructed. Next, we use nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) as a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) to solve the MOO model and thereby derive Pareto optimal solutions. Finally, we adopt the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) to obtain the optimal design from the Pareto solutions. A case study of car form design is conducted to demonstrate the proposed approach. The results suggest that this approach is feasible and effective in obtaining optimal designs and can provide great insight for product form design.

AB Effective maintenance strategies are of utmost significance for system engineering due to their direct linkage with financial aspects and safety of the plants' operation. At a point where the state of a system, for instance, level of its deterioration, can be constantly observed, a strategy based on condition-based maintenance (CBM) may be affected; wherein upkeep of the system is done progressively on the premise of monitored state of the system. In this article, a multicomponent framework is considered that is continuously kept under observation. In order to decide an optimal deterioration stage for the said system, Genetic Algorithm (GA) technique has been utilized that figures out when its preventive maintenance should be carried out. The system is configured into a multiobjective problem that is aimed at optimizing the two desired objectives, namely, profitability and accessibility. For the sake of reality, a prognostic model portraying the advancements of deteriorating system has been employed that will be based on utilization of continuous event simulation techniques. In this regard, Monte Carlo (MC) simulation has been shortlisted as it can take into account a wide range of probable options that can help in reducing uncertainty. The inherent benefits proffered by the said simulation technique are fully utilized to display various elements of a deteriorating system working under stressed environment. The proposed synergic model (GA andMC) is considered to bemore effective due to the employment of "drop-by-drop approach" that permits successful drive of the related search process with regard to the best optimal solutions.

AB With the expansion of the study about green logistics, sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has appeared as a new concept in current economic circumstance. This paper studies the sustainability optimization of enterprise logistics network from a strategic perspective and proposes a multiobjective sustainable logistics optimization model considering three dimensions of sustainability: economy, environment, and society. In this model, the environment factor was measured with a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method based on Chinese Life Cycle Database (CLCD), while for social factors, Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (GRI) are utilized to quantify the social performance. Moreover, the model was solved with an adapted version of the alpha-constraint method named augment constraint algorithm (AUGMENCON) through GAMS software. The numerical experiment results of a computer manufacturer supply chain show that the proposed model is able to integrate all dimensions of sustainability and simultaneously prove the capability of AUGMENCON in providing a set of trade-off solutions for the decision makers to make different decisions under different environment and social requirements.

AB Nowadays, railway infrastructure designers rely heavily on computer simulators and expert systems to model, analyze and evaluate potential deployments prior to their installation. This paper presents the railway power consumption simulator model (RPCS), a cloud-based model for the design, simulation and evaluation of railway electric infrastructures. This model integrates the parameters of an infrastructure within a search engine that generates and evaluates a set of simulations to achieve optimal designs, according to a given set of objectives and restrictions. The knowledge of the domain is represented as an ontology that translates the elements in the infrastructure into an electric circuit, which is simulated to obtain a wide range of electric metrics. In order to support the execution of thousands of scenarios in a scalable, efficient and fault-tolerant manner, this paper introduces an architecture to deploy the model in a cloud environment, and a dimensioning model to find the types and number of instances that maximize performance while minimizing the externalization costs. The resulting model is applied to a particular case study, allowing the execution of over one thousand concurrent experiments in a virtual cluster on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud.

AB Intensive heuristic and metaheuristic research efforts have focused on the Pareto front optimization of discrete time-cost trade-off problem (DTCTP). However, very little success has been achieved in solving the problem for medium and large-scale projects. This paper presents a new particle swarm optimization method to achieve an advancement in the Pareto front optimization of medium and large-scale construction projects. The proposed Pareto front particle swarm optimizer (PFPSO) is based on a multiobjective optimization environment with novel particle representation, initialization, and position-updating principles that are specifically designed for simultaneous time-cost optimization of large-scale projects. PFPSO brings several benefits for the discrete time-cost optimization, such as an adequate representation of the discrete search space, fast convergence properties, and improved Pareto front optimization capabilities. The computational experiment results reveal that the new particle swarm optimization method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, both in terms of the number of Pareto front solutions and computation time, especially for medium and large-scale problems. A large number of nondominated solutions are achieved within seconds for the first time, for a problem including 720 activities. The proposed Pareto front particle swarm optimizer provides a fast and effective method for optimal scheduling of construction projects. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB This study develops and tests a method for multiobjective optimization of water-quality monitoring networks in river-reservoir systems. The optimization method identifies optimal sampling locations to detect the sudden release of contaminants to a reservoir, and meets two objectives: (1) minimizing the prediction error of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) at the reservoir's outlet valve; and (2) minimizing the average time during which MTBE is detected at sampling locations. The optimization method considers 36 contaminant scenarios, corresponding to three volumes of contaminant release, three release locations, and four different seasonal release times. The MTBE pollutant chemograph was simulated at the outlet valve of the reservoir and at 16 possible sampling locations with the CE-QUAL-W2 model for each of the 36 scenarios of contaminant release. A support vector regression (SVR) tool is coupled to the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII) to optimize the water-quality sampling locations. Implementation of the NSGAII-SVR method demonstrates its capacity to design water-quality monitoring networks that meet multiple objectives in a river-reservoir system.

AB This study applies a recently developed evolutionary algorithm (EA) called state of matter search (SMS) to minimize the total energy deficit in the Karun4 reservoir, Iran. The operation of the Karun4 reservoir is influenced by several factors, which requires a multiple criteria framework for selecting the most suitable solution EA. Five EAs, in addition to the SMS, were evaluated for the reservoir operation problem on the basis of four performance criteria and the fitness function (FF) value. The priority assessment on the basis of FF value revealed that the SMS outperformed the other EAs in converging to the optimal solution. However, judged by the other four performance criteria, based on weighted aggregates sum product assessment (WASPAS) technique, particle swarm optimization (PSO) proved superior to the other EAs. This paper's results show that the selection of a solution EA for solving complex reservoir optimization problem requires a multicriteria decision-making process. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are well-suited for the task. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB Stormwater low-impact development (LID) has become an important method for the reduction of stormwater runoff emanating from impervious surfaces to local water bodies. The extra runoff from human-made impervious surfaces overloads water bodies with polluted runoff. Since many LID best management practices (BMPs) exist, and many areas have multiple subcatchments, it is important to carefully select which BMPs to place in each subcatchment and its placement in order to minimize cost, but also to give the highest chance of owner BMP maintenance. LID BMPs are often constructed on private land and maintenance can be at the owner's expense and, therefore, not guaranteed. A new algorithm, entitled multi-objective, socio-economic, boundary-emanating, nearest distance (MOSEBEND), that is easily used by practitioners is introduced and demonstrated here for a road in a community showing that the algorithm allows the selection of the set of BMPs on the various subcatchments with the lowest cost, highest runoff restoration to natural values, and highest likelihood of private-owner maintenance. The BMP selection and location starts at the downstream watershed boundary and propagates upstream, and then works in the upstream-to-downstream direction from the upstream watershed boundary. The multiple objectives addressed are cost-benefit ratio (CBR) and maintenance probability factor (MPF). The optimal solution is considered to be the one closest to the origin on a plot of CBR and MPF. It was found that the new algorithm resulted in a solution that is (1) low cost, (2) high benefit, and (3) more likely to be built and maintained than an analysis of any subset of these three objectives. The option with the highest cost-benefit-ratio is that in which LID BMPs are implemented in the upper and steeper portion of the catchment, for the watershed that the algorithm is demonstrated herein. However, that option has a less likely chance to be maintained and, therefore, is not ranked first by the MOSEBEND algorithm proposed here. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB It is possible to consider uncertainty simultaneously with the design process. In fact, a Budget of Uncertainty(BoU) can be determined alongside the design solution, allowing the determination of uncertainty intervals for selected design variables and problem parameters. This paper presents a new strategy for optimization under uncertainty which provides for this simultaneous design and uncertainty determination. To test the theory, a simple Taylor series expansion strategy is used to propagate uncertainty in a design problem's objectives and constraints and a new BoU design algorithm is formulated. Due to the need for competing objectives, nominal performance and robust design, the new formulation is a multiobjective problem with primary and secondary weights to allow for lexicographic weights of uncertain parameters and variation between optimal and robust solutions. This paper compares and contrasts three different Goal Programming techniques as solutions to the multiobjective problem. Within the paper, the term Budget of Uncertainty (BoU) is used to describe the fundamental idea of uncertainty allocation across design variables and problem parameters as well as for a shorthand to describe the presented formulation. An engineering design problem, that of a helical spring, is presented to further illustrate the new method, and an uncertainty budget is considered which trades uncertainty in coil diameter against uncertainty in wire diameter.

AB This paper proposes a stepwise structural design methodology where the component layout and the supporting frame structure is sequentially found using global search algorithm and topology optimization. In the component layout design step, the genetic algorithm is used to handle system level multiobjective problem where the optimal locations of multiple components are searched. Based on the layout design searched, a new Topology Optimization method based on Morphing Mesh technique (TOMM) is applied to obtain the frame structure topology while adjusting the component locations simultaneously. TOMM is based on the SIMP method with morphable FE mesh, and component relocation and frame design is simultaneously done using two kinds of design variables: topology design variables and morphing design variables. Two examples are studied in this paper. First, TOMM method is applied to a simple cantilever beam problem to validate the proposed design methodology and justify inclusion of morphing design variables. Then the stepwise design methodology is applied to the commercial Boeing 757 aircraft wing design problem for the optimal placement of multiple components (subsystems) and the optimal supporting frame structure around them. Additional constraint on the weight balance is included and the corresponding design sensitivity is formulated. The benefit of using the global search algorithm (genetic algorithm) is discussed in terms of finding the global optimum and independency of initial design guess. It has been proved that the proposed stepwise method can provide innovative design insight for complex modern engineering systems with multi-component structures.

AB This paper shows a case study for a simultaneous optimization of blank shape and variable blank holder force (VBHF) trajectory in deep drawing, which is one of the challenging issues in sheet metal forming in industry. Blank shape directly affects the material cost. To reduce the material cost, it is important to determine an optimal blank shape minimizing earing. In addition, VBHF approach is recognized as an attractive and crucial technology for successful sheet metal forming, but the practical application is rarely reported. To resolve these issues, the simultaneous optimization of blank shape and VBHF trajectory is performed. First, the experiment to identify the wrinkling region is carried out. Based on the experimental results, the finite element analysis (FEA) model is developed. The validity of the FEA model is examined by using the FLD. Numerical simulation in deep drawing is so intensive that a sequential approximate optimization (SAO) using a radial basis function (RBF) network is used for the numerical optimization. Based on the numerical result, the experiment using the AC servo press is carried out. It is found from the experimental results that the successful sheet metal forming is performed. In addition, it is confirmed from the numerical and experimental result that both the material cost and the forming energy are simultaneously reduced by using the design optimization technique.

AB This paper presents the crashworthiness design optimisation of a typical vehicle structure subjected to offset deformable barrier and full rigid barrier impact cases. Several approaches involving sampling techniques, surrogate model, multi-objective optimisation algorithm and reliability analysis are introduced and applied. Four correlation functions of Kriging are adopted for the design optimisation. It shows that the accuracy of the correlation functions is different and the best one is selected for the objective or constraint function. Both the deterministic optimisation and reliability-based design optimisation (RBDO) are conducted. In RBDO, the reliability levels of constraints are computed through the first-order reliability method (FORM) and second-order reliability method (SORM), and are compared with Monte Carlo simulation. It is found that SORM is more accurate than FORM when the constraint functions are highly nonlinear. Finally, the results demonstrate that RBDO solutions are more reliable than that of the deterministic optimisation for real engineering application. RBDO solutions are further validated by finite element analysis model, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed RRDO approach in obtaining the reliable optimal design of the vehicle structures.

AB A design methodology is presented that supports the design of future aerospace rocket-powered vehicles. In particular, it provides the capabilities to rapidly evaluate the performance, weight, size, and lifecycle costs of all chemical rocket engines at a conceptual level. By leveraging cycle-based approaches and surrogate modeling techniques, the performance of all chemical rocket engines can be evaluated with an accuracy of 3%, whereas it divides the execution time by a factor of 105 compared to current physics-based models. New mass-estimating relationships are developed for estimating the weight and the size of solid engines with an improved accuracy compared to existing models. Physics-based models built around the key design drivers are used for the weight and size estimation of liquid and hybrid engines. Although existing cost-estimating relationships are used to evaluate the lifecycle costs of solid and liquid engines, a more physics-based model is developed for hybrid engines. Although it supports complex multiobjective optimizations and rapid trade-off analyses, this environment is also the first of its sort able to estimate the lifecycle costs of hybrid rocket engines.

AB Thin-walled structures have been widely used as energy absorbers due to their significant advantages on crashworthiness and light weight. Relatively few studies have been reported about thin-walled structures with variable diameter along the longitudinal direction in a nonlinear manner. In this paper, a new functionally graded thin-walled structure with variable diameter (functionally graded tapered tube, FGTT) is introduced; and its crashworthiness is comprehensively discussed in terms of specific energy absorption (SEA) and initial peak crushing force (IPCF). The results show that FGTT is of great advantages on energy absorption over the conventionally straight/tapered circular tubes under the same weight. Then, a parametric study is carried out to investigate the effects of wall thickness, gradient variations of section and diameter range between top and bottom diameters on the crashworthiness of FGTTs. Finally, the multiobjective non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used to further optimise the FGTTs for maximising SEA and minimising IPCF. The optimal FGTTs are found to have superior crashworthiness and great potential for energy absorber.

AB Robust calibration of an agricultural-hydrological model is critical for simulating crop yield and water quality and making reasonable agricultural management. However, calibration of the agricultural-hydrological system models is challenging because of model complexity, the existence of strong parameter correlation, and significant computational requirements. Therefore, only a limited number of simulations can be allowed in any attempt to find a near-optimal solution within an affordable time, which greatly restricts the successful application of the model. The goal of this study is to locate the optimal solution of the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) given a limited simulation time, so as to improve the model simulation and help make rational and effective agricultural-hydrological decisions. To this end, we propose a computationally efficient global optimization procedure using sparse-grid based surrogates. We first used advanced sparse grid (SG) interpolation to construct a surrogate system of the actual RZWQM2, and then we calibrate the surrogate model using the global optimization algorithm, Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO). As the surrogate model is a polynomial with fast evaluation, it can be efficiently evaluated with a sufficiently large number of times during the optimization, which facilitates the global search. We calibrate seven model parameters against five years of yield, drain flow, and NO3-N loss data from a subsurface-drained corn-soybean field in Iowa. Results indicate that an accurate surrogate model can be created for the RZWQM2 with a relatively small number of SG points (i.e., RZWQM2 runs). Compared to the conventional QPSO algorithm, our surrogate based optimization method can achieve a smaller objective function value and better calibration performance using a fewer number of expensive RZWQM2 executions, which greatly improves computational efficiency.

AB This paper studies multiobjective optimal control problems in presence of constraints in the discrete time framework. Both the finite- and infinite-horizon settings are considered. The paper provides necessary conditions of Pareto optimality under lighter smoothness assumptions compared to the previously obtained results. These conditions are given in the form of weak and strong Pontryagin principles which generalize the existing ones. To obtain some of these results, we provide new multiplier rules for multiobjective static optimization problems and new Pontryagin principles for the finite horizon multiobjective optimal control problems.

AB Fish protein hydrolysates (FPH) from horse mackerel were produced by employing an enzyme mixture of subtilisin and trypsin. The antioxidant activity of fish hydrolysates (DPPH scavenging activity, Fe2+ chelating activity and Fe3+ reducing power) was modelled as a function of the operating conditions for the hydrolysis (i.e. protein concentration, temperature and composition of the enzyme mixture). The antioxidant activities showed different behavior depending on whether their controlling pathway was the transference of electrons/protons (i.e. DPPH scavenging activity and Fe3+ reducing power) or metal chelation. In the first case, the antioxidant activities increased with the decrease of substrate concentration and temperature when pure trypsin (DPPH scavenging activity) or a mixture of enzymes (Fe3+ reducing capacity) was employed. Contrarily, hydrolysates showed higher Fe2+ chelating activities at moderate concentration and high temperature (i.e. 5 g/L and 55 degrees C) employing solely subtilisin. The conflictive behavior among the antioxidant properties suggested using a multiobjective optimization technique. The epsilon-constraint method was chosen for this purpose. This approach allows determining the most adequate operational conditions for producing hydrolysate with a specific antioxidant profile which is the first approximation to the production of taylor-made antioxidant hydrolysates.

AB Solid waste management is a complex domain involving the interaction of several dimensions; thus, its analysis and control impose continuous challenges for decision makers. In this context, multi-criteria decision-making models have become important and convenient supporting tools for solid waste management because they can handle problems involving multiple dimensions and conflicting criteria. However, the selection of the multi-criteria decision-making method is a hard task since there are several multi-criteria decision-making approaches, each one with a large number of variants whose applicability depends on information availability and the aim of the study. Therefore, to support researchers and decision makers, the objectives of this article are to present a literature review of multi-criteria decision-making applications used in solid waste management, offer a critical assessment of the current practices, and provide suggestions for future works. A brief review of fundamental concepts on this topic is first provided, followed by the analysis of 260 articles related to the application of multi-criteria decision making in solid waste management. These studies were investigated in terms of the methodology, including specific steps such as normalisation, weighting, and sensitivity analysis. In addition, information related to waste type, the study objective, and aspects considered was recorded. From the articles analysed it is noted that studies using multi-criteria decision making in solid waste management are predominantly addressed to problems related to municipal solid waste involving facility location or management strategy.

AB In order to improve the energy efficiency (EE) in cognitive radio (CR), a joint optimal energy-efficient cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) and transmission in multi-channel CR is proposed in this paper. EE is described as a tradeoff between the throughput and the entirely consumed power. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize EE by jointly optimizing local sensing time, number of cooperative sensing secondary users (SU), transmission bandwidth and power. A combined optimization algorithm of bi-level optimization, Polyblock optimization and Dinkelbach's optimization is proposed to solve the proposed non-convex optimization problem effectively. The simulation results show that, compared with throughput maximization model (TMM), the energy efficiency maximization model (EEMM) improves EE of the CR system and limits the excessive power consumption effectively.

AB The optimal design of laminated composite panels with constrained layer damping (CLD) treatments is addressed in this article. The objectives are simultaneously to minimize weight and maximize modal damping. The design variables are the number and position of CLD patch treatments on the surface of the laminated plate. The problem is solved using Direct MultiSearch solver, which does not use any derivatives of the objective functions. A finite element model for sandwich plates with viscoelastic core and laminated face layers is used. Trade-off Pareto optimal fronts and the respective treatment configurations are obtained and the results are analyzed and discussed.

AB This paper reviews the literature published over the past 30 years on the blade-end treatment in axial compressors. The blade-end treatment reduces the endwall losses and extends the stable margin by modifying the blade shape near the endwall region with end-bend, end-dihedral and end-sweep flow control measures. The end-bend improves the overall performance by aligning the blade inlet/outlet to the flow stream direction. The end-dihedral reduces the blade force on the endwalls, while the end-sweep not only reduces the shock losses, but also controls the spanwise migration of the blade surface boundary layer. All these effects strongly influence the compressor performance by modifying the blading loading distribution in the streamwise or spanwise directions. However, the benefit of the endwall flow control comes with increased losses in the mainstream so there is a trade-off between the improved endwall region flows and the degraded mid-span flows. Thus, how to combine end-bend, end-dihedral and end-sweep to achieve the correct balance of loss distribution, appears to be the key to a successful three-dimensional compressor design.

AB The paper presents an application of an evolutionary multi-objective optimization method in the estimation a Pareto optimal set of solutions of pipe replacement schedule. An optimization task is a problem with total investment cost, system entropy, hydraulic reliability and water losses as the objective functions. The paper shows that it is possible to optimize a part of a water distribution system without a deterioration of the crucial parameters in the rest of it, which also results in reduction of a computational complexity. Next, the paper presents how to select the pipes that have to be replaced by application of specific coding of decision variables. The results, based on real life example shows that the method is able to identify the payoff surface characteristic between the proposed objectives.

AB The multiobjective set covering problem (MOSCP), a challenging combinatorial optimization problem, has received limited attention in the literature. This paper presents a heuristic algorithm to approximate the Pareto set of the MOSCP. The proposed algorithm applies a local branching approach on a tree structure and is enhanced with a node exploration strategy specially developed for the MOSCP. The main idea is to partition the search region into smaller subregions based on the neighbors of a reference solution and then to explore each subregion for the Pareto points of the MOSCP. Numerical experiments for instances with two, three and four objectives set covering problems are reported. Results on a performance comparison with benchmark algorithms from the literature are also included and show that the new algorithm is competitive and performs best on some instances.

AB This paper presents a new optimization algorithm called fuzzy adaptive teaching-learning-based optimization (FATLBO) for solving numerical structural problems. This new algorithm introduces three new mechanisms for increasing the searching capability of teaching-learning-based optimization namely status monitor, fuzzy adaptive teaching-learning strategies, and remedial operator. The performance of FATLBO is compared with well-known optimization methods on 26 unconstrained mathematical problems and five structural engineering design problems. Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that FATLBO is able to deliver excellence and competitive performance in solving various structural optimization problems.

AB Performance prediction of the electric discharge machining (EDM) process is the key to the overall study of EDM. Two approaches currently exist for predicting performance; one is an experimental approach and is dependent upon recurrent experiments while the other is a numerical approach with typically poor accuracy. A novel numerical method is proposed in this study to predict different materials' EDM process performance under various conditions in an effective and economic way. This method is based on the specific discharge energy (SDE), a significant factor characterizing performance of materials in the EDM process. The materials with similar SDE exhibit similar performance under same conditions and materials with lower SDE tend to be removed quicker but with diminished performance. A numerical model of the EDM process considering the parameters-variant proportion of the energy distribution and equivalent temperature is established to compute the value of SDE and the model is compared with the previous models. The method is tested utilizing three different materials and is proved to be effective for predicting EDM performance, ultimately providing a convenient and accurate implication to guide manufacturing of various materials, especially new and/or expensive materials.

AB In today's competitive electricity market, managing transmission congestion in deregulated power system has created challenges for independent system operators to operate the transmission lines reliably within the limits. This paper proposes a new meta-heuristic algorithm, called as symbiotic organisms search (SOS) algorithm, for congestion management (CM) problem in pool-based electricity market by real power rescheduling of generators. Inspired by interactions among organisms in ecosystem, SOS algorithm is a recent population-based algorithm which does not require any algorithm specific control parameters unlike other algorithms. Various security constraints such as load bus voltage and line loading are taken into account while dealing with the CM problem. In this paper, the proposed SOS algorithm is applied on modified IEEE 30- and 57-bus test power system for the solution of CM problem. The results, thus, obtained are compared to those reported in the recent state-of-the-art literature. The efficacy of the proposed SOS algorithm for obtaining the higher quality solution is also established.

AB Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are currently a dynamic field of research that has attracted considerable attention. Mutation operators have been utilized by MOEAs as variation mechanisms. In particular, polynomial mutation (PLM) is one of the most popular variation mechanisms and has been utilized by many well-known MOEAs. In this paper, we revisit the PLM operator and we propose a fitness-guided version of the PLM. Experimental results obtained by non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II and strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 show that the proposed fitness-guided mutation operator outperforms the classical PLM operator, based on different performance metrics that evaluate both the proximity of the solutions to the Pareto front and their dispersion on it.

The key idea is to switch among different algorithms during the optimization search based on the predicted performance of each algorithm at the time. Algorithm performance is modeled using a machine learning technique based on the available information. The predicted best algorithm is then selected to run for a limited number of evaluations. The proposed approach is tested on several benchmark problems and the results are compared against those obtained using any one of the candidate algorithms alone.

AB Time, cost, and quality are three key control factors in rockfill dam construction, and the tradeoff among them is important. Research has focused on the construction time-cost-quality tradeoff for the planning or design phase, built on static empirical data. However, due to its intrinsic uncertainties, rockfill dam construction is a dynamic process which requires the tradeoff to adjust dynamically to changes in construction conditions. In this study, a dynamic time-cost-quality tradeoff (DTCQT) method is proposed to balance time, cost, and quality at any stage of the construction process. A time-cost-quality tradeoff model is established that considers time cost and quality cost. Time, cost, and quality are dynamically estimated based on real-time monitoring. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method is applied to quantify the decision preferences among time, cost, and quality as objective weights. In addition, an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) coupled with the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is used to search for the optimal compromise solution. A case study project is analyzed to demonstrate the applicability of the method, and the efficiency of the proposed optimization method is compared with that of the linear weighted sum (LWS) and NSGA-II.

AB In this study, electrical discharge machining has been used to machine insulating zirconia via the assisting electrode method. The process parameter optimization was investigated by combining the Taguchi method with grey relational analysis. The application of Taguchi-grey relational analysis is proven to effectively improve the performance of electrical discharge machining in drilling insulating zirconia. The results of this analysis indicate that the final optimal process parameters are a peak current of 8 A, a pulse duration of 16 mu s, a duty cycle of 0.5, and a flushing pressure of 6 MPa. Additionally, the material removal rate, electrode wear rate, and hole taper ratio increase by 39%, 1.5%, and 1.3%, respectively, which improves the grey relational grade by 6.8%. The electrical resistance test confirms that the conductivity of the conductive layer obtained using the final optimal process parameters is better than that of the conductive layer obtained using the initial optimal process parameters. Energy spectrum analysis reveals that the conductive layer is composed of C, Cu, Zn, Zr, and O. Analysis of variance shows that the most significant component of the multi-responses is the peak current, with a 51.4% contribution.

AB Water cycle algorithm (WCA) is a new population-based meta-heuristic technique. It is originally inspired by idealized hydrological cycle observed in natural environment. The conventional WCA is capable to demonstrate a superior performance compared to other well-established techniques in solving constrained and also unconstrained problems. Similar to other meta-heuristics, premature convergence to local optima may still be happened in dealing with some specific optimization tasks. Similar to chaos in real water cycle behavior, this article incorporates chaotic patterns into stochastic processes of WCA to improve the performance of conventional algorithm and to mitigate its premature convergence problem. First, different chaotic signal functions along with various chaotic-enhanced WCA strategies (totally 39 meta-heuristics) are implemented, and the best signal is preferred as the most appropriate chaotic technique for modification of WCA. Second, the chaotic algorithm is employed to tackle various benchmark problems published in the specialized literature and also training of neural networks. The comparative statistical results of new technique vividly demonstrate that premature convergence problem is relieved significantly. Chaotic WCA with sinusoidal map and chaotic-enhanced operators not only can exploit high-quality solutions efficiently but can outperform WCA optimizer and other investigated algorithms.

AB The compressed air energy storage (CAES) system, considered as one method for peaking shaving and load-levelling of the electricity system, has excellent characteristics of energy storage and utilization. However, due to the waste heat existing in compressed air during the charge stage and exhaust gas during the discharge stage, the efficient operation of the conventional CAES system has been greatly restricted. The Kalina cycle (KC) and organic Rankine cycle (ORC) have been proven to be two worthwhile technologies to fulfill the different residual heat recovery for energy systems. To capture and reuse the waste heat from the CAES system, two systems (the CAES system combined with KC and ORC, respectively) are proposed in this paper. The sensitivity analysis shows the effect of the compression ratio and the temperature of the exhaust on the system performance: the KC-CAES system can achieve more efficient operation than the ORC-CAES system under the same temperature of exhaust gas; meanwhile, the larger compression ratio can lead to the higher efficiency for the KC-CAES system than that of ORC-CAES with the constant temperature of the exhaust gas. In addition, the evolutionary multi-objective algorithm is conducted between the thermodynamic and economic performances to find the optimal parameters of the two systems. The optimum results indicate that the solutions with an exergy efficiency of around 59.74% and 53.56% are promising for KC-CAES and ORC-CAES system practical designs, respectively.

AB A new design methodology for radiofrequency circuits is presented that includes electromagnetic (EM) simulation of the inductors into the optimization flow. This is achieved by previously generating the Pareto-optimal front (POF) of the inductors using EM simulation. Inductors are selected from the Pareto front and their S-parameter matrix is included in the circuit netlist that is simulated using an RF simulator. Generating the EM-simulated POF of inductors is computationally expensive, but once generated, it can be used for any circuit design. The methodology is illustrated both for a single-objective and a multiobjective optimization of a low noise amplifier.

AB In this paper, we introduce a novel dynamic data driven adaptive simulation framework for the operation and control of microgrids (MGs) that significantly accelerates the real-time computation of the resource allocation, and controls decisions to optimize the operational cost, energy surety, as well as emissions per MW. The proposed framework includes a database receiving input from electrical and environmental sensors, a fault detection algorithm that discovers liabilities and potential hazards within the MG, an agent-based simulation of the MG system, an optimal computing budget allocation-based control selection algorithm that uses the agent-based simulation to decide the best control design of the MG, and a multiobjective algorithm for optimizing the decisions of the MG given the best control design. For validating our framework, we use the structure of a realistic MG that is simulated using real-historical data. The experiments reveal that the proposed framework significantly reduces the computational burden of a considerably complex multiobjective problem.

AB Price differentiation is a commonly used practice in Revenue Management (RM) to improve a firm's profitability. However, most studies in the literature have considered a risk-neutral firm to demonstrate the benefits of price differentiation. The main contribution of this paper is in considering several important objectives while determining the optimal product prices and order (production) quantities for a risk-adjusted firm with demand leakage effects in the presence of a price-dependent stochastic demand. The objectives considered include the maximization of a firm's expected profit and maximizing the probability of exceeding the risk adjusted expected revenue. Closed-form expressions for optimal product prices and production quantities are derived for several of these objectives. A numerical study is also presented to calibrate the impact of a firm's risk tolerance and other factors such as demand leakage, market demand variability on the firm's profitability and its optimal decision.

AB Considering the operation process rebuilding (OPR) of manufacturing/operation systems, we propose a dynamic interactive bilevel maintenance methodology to satisfy rapid market changes. Predictive maintenance (PdM) intervals at the machine level are dynamically scheduled by a multiobjective model for each diverse machine. A system-level opportunistic maintenance (OM) policy is proposed to facilitate PdM optimizations according to OPR activities. This novel OPR-OM policy utilizes a variable maintenance time window to construct optimal maintenance schedules that are suitable for changeable system structures. The results obtained by applying this methodology at Shanghai Port indicate that the proposed methodology can help a port transportation system to achieve rapid responses to OPR activities, which can significantly improve system efficiency and economy.
   Note to Practitioners-The majority of existing maintenance strategies focus on fixed system structures, which scarcely consider changeable system structures derived from operation process rebuilding (OPR). Thus, this paper, which is motivated by this problem, attempts to satisfy flexible needs in a keenly competitive market. This paper proposes a bilevel maintenance methodology that is integrated with OPR to achieve cost-effective and fast-responding system-level maintenance optimizations. Implementation of the proposed methodology involves the following basic steps: 1) collect individual machine condition data; 2) prepare machine-level maintenance schedules according to a multiobjective model (maintenance cost rate, machine availability, and operation profit rate); and 3) utilize a variable maintenance time window to optimize system-level maintenance according to OPR activities. The bilevel methodology can be easily modified according to practical requirements, i.e., other decision-making objectives at the machine level and the maintenance time window range at the system level.

ID KERNEL; RECOGNITION; MODEL
AB Domain adaptation learning (DAL) investigates how to perform a task across different domains. In this paper, we present a kernelized local-global approach to solve domain adaptation problems. The basic idea of the proposed method is to consider the global and local information regarding the domains (e.g., maximum mean discrepancy and intraclass distance) and to convert the domain adaptation problem into a bi-object optimization problem via the kernel method. A solution for the optimization problem will help us identify a latent space in which the distributions of the different domains will be close to each other in the global sense, and the local properties of the labeled source samples will be preserved. Therefore, classic classification algorithms can be used to recognize unlabeled target domain data, which has a significant difference on the source samples. Based on the analysis, we validate the proposed algorithm using four different sources of data: synthetic, textual, object, and facial image. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method provides a reasonable means to improve DAL algorithms.

AB The bias feature is a major factor that makes a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) difficult for multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). To deal with this problem feature, an algorithm should carefully balance between exploration and exploitation. The decomposition-based MOEA decomposes an MOP into a number of single objective subproblems and solves them in a collaborative manner. Single objective optimizers can be easily used in this algorithm framework. Covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) has proven to be able to strike good balance between the exploration and the exploitation of search space. This paper proposes a scheme to use both differential evolution (DE) and covariance matrix adaptation in the MOEA based on decomposition. In this scheme, single objective optimization problems are clustered into several groups. To reduce the computational overhead, only one subproblem from each group is selected to optimize by CMA-ES while other subproblems are optimized by DE. When an evolution strategy procedure meets some stopping criteria, it will be reinitialized and used for solving another subproblem in the same group. A set of new multiobjective test problems with bias features are constructed in this paper. Extensive experimental studies show that our proposed algorithm is suitable for dealing with problems with biases.

AB Dynamic multiobjective optimization (DMO) has received growing research interest in recent years since many real-world optimization problems appear to not only have multiple objectives that conflict with each other but also change over time. The time-varying characteristics of these DMO problems (DMOPs) pose new challenges to evolutionary algorithms. Considering the importance of a representative and diverse set of benchmark functions for DMO, in this paper, we propose a new benchmark generator that is able to tune a number of challenging characteristics, including mixed Pareto-optimal front (convexity-concavity), nonmonotonic and time-varying variable-linkages, mixed types of changes, and randomness in type change, which have rarely or not been considered or tested in the literature. A test suite of ten instances with different dynamic features is produced from the generator in this paper. Additionally, a few new performance measures are proposed to evaluate algorithms for DMOPs with different characteristics. Six representative multiobjective evolutionary algorithms from the literature are investigated based on the proposed DMO test suite and performance measures. The experimental results facilitate a better understanding of strengths and weaknesses of these compared algorithms for DMOPs.

AB This paper proposes an evolutionary approach for optimizing crew roster recovery (CRR) problems, in which rosters for multiday flight duties are reassigned after disruptions, under a set of constraints involving practical management issues, safety regulations, and preallocated activities. In the proposed approach, CRR problems are first formulated as combinational optimization problems containing multiple objectives and constraints, and a variant of the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II method is used to explore Pareto solutions. To analyze the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a real-world rostering problem was studied. For the test instance, experimental results showed the advantages of the proposed approach compared with previous work in the literature. By simulating disruption events on the real-world rostering plan, we studied two recovery scenarios containing sufficient and insufficient available crews in the experiments. In particular, a constraint-loosening mechanism that conditionally replaced preallocated tasks with flight duties was proposed in a resource-shortage case to explore the Pareto solutions. The experimental results show that the proposed approach attains a favorable solution quality and can generate multiple recovery plans for decision makers.

AB Aerodynamic shape optimization (ASO) for aircraft is the focus of concern as well as the subject of substantial research issue in aerospace engineering. This paper proposes a novel TLBO (teaching-learning based optimization based) memetic algorithm (TLBO-MA) for optimizing the aerodynamic shape. In the proposed TLBO-MA, an adaptive teaching factor, conservation of information inspired operator and multi-meme learning are incorporated to enhance the searching behavior of standard TLBO. Simulation based on well-known benchmarks and ASO for HTV-2 prototype demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed TLBO-MA.

AB Liquid separation condenser (LSC) is a newly developed fin-and-tube condenser. It is superior to other traditional condenser because of its relatively low pressure drop without reducing heat transfer coefficient. It is suitable to be used in the organic Rankine cycle. However, the design of LSC is a very complex and time consuming task base on traditional methods. In this study, a new modelling, simulation and optimization methodology for LSC design is developed. A pass-by-pass tube side modelling method is proposed. An equivalent heat transfer coefficient and total pressure drop are defined, modelled and validated. Then, a mathematical model containing multiple continuous and discrete variables for the optimal design of LSC is developed. The main continuous variables are tube length, pressure drops, fluid velocity, air velocity, heat transfer area, and outlet air temperature. The main discrete variables are the type selection of finned-tubes, number of passes, number of tubes per pass, fin number per unit tube length. The objective function is the minimization of the total cost, which is the best trade-off between the heat transfer coefficient and the pressure drop. The resulting model is a non-convex mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model. A solving strategy that integrates model relaxation, solver selection, and tube-pass scheme initialization is proposed. Two case studies are elaborated to test the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Comparison of the optimization results with base case reveals that the proposed methodology can be successfully applied to the design optimization of LSC. The influences of pass number, fin number, tube-fin type, tube number, and investment cost on the optimization results are also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Buildings worldwide consume approximately 45% of primary energy sources, making it the single largest energy consumption sector. The importance of improving a building's energy performance was emphasized by the government with the enforcement of sustainable building policies. Article 9 of the Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and the Council (19th May 2010) on the energy performance of buildings states the importance of stimulating refurbishment of existing buildings into near zero-energy buildings. However, the effectiveness of the process depends on the basic building structure and the refurbishment designs. Hence, methods to find the effective strategies for retrofitting and modelling to predict energy reduction is vital. Unlike the previous studies, this paper presents a method for a deep building retrofit based on the whole building's thermal analysis specifically for cooling demand countries. This work set against recommended best practice office building energy benchmarks in Malaysia, and following a comprehensive building audit, a retrofit strategy was proposed based on target building's thermal analysis with cooling demand reduction in particular focus. It was found that 71% of the building's heat gain emanated from its lighting system and solar heat gain through windows. A 40.2% reduction in the building's cooling load is estimated to reduce 47% of the total energy consumption. A comparison of the actual and simulated energy results suggested that the simulation made under predicted the energy reduction by 4.3%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The United Nations agenda for sustainable development by the year 2030 proposes 17 sustainable development goals which include access to affordable, reliable and clean energy, sustained economic growth with full productive employment and, urgent action to mitigate environmental degradation. Planning for sustainable development requires integrating conflicting criteria on economy, energy, environment and social aspects. In this paper, we introduce a Weighted Goal Programming model involving criteria on the economic development (GDP), the electricity consumption, the greenhouse gas emissions, and the total number of employees to determine optimal labor allocation across various economic sectors. The proposed model is validated with data from the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (namely Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates). The results of the model aim to provide empirical evidence and insights to decision makers and policy analysts in developing optimal strategies able to simultaneously satisfy energy demand, economic growth, labor development and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to achieve sustainability targets by the year 2030.

AB Forward and reverse supply chains form a closed-loop supply chain. In this paper, a mathematical model is proposed for a closed-loop supply chain network by considering global factors, including exchange rates and customs duties. The model is a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model under uncertain demand. A solution approach based on fuzzy programming is developed for solving the optimization problem. The model is then applied in a network, which is located in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. A sensitivity analysis is provided to validate the model. This model considers global factors, multi objectives, and uncertainty simultaneously in a closed-loop supply chain network. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Software product line (SPL) scoping is an important phase when planning for product line adoption. An SPL scope specifies: (1) the extent of the domain supported by the product line, (2) portfolio of products in the product line and (3) list of assets to be developed for reuse across the family of products.
   Issue: SPL scope planning is usually based on estimates about the state of the market and the engineering capabilities of the development team. One challenge with these estimates is that there are inaccuracies due to uncertainty in the environment or accuracy of measurement. This may result in issues ranging from suboptimal plans to infeasible plans.
   Objective: To address the above, we propose to include uncertainty as part of the SPL scoping model. Plans developed in consideration of uncertainty would be more robust against possible fluctuations in estimates.
   Approach: In this paper, a method to incorporate uncertainty in scoping optimization and its application to generate robust solutions is proposed. We capture uncertainty as part of the formulation and model scoping optimization as a multi-objective problem with profit and stability as fitness functions. Profit stability and feasibility stability are considered to represent stability concerns.
   Results: Results show that, compared to other scope optimization approaches, both performance stability and feasibility stability are improved while maintaining near optimal performance for profit objective. Also, generated results consist of solutions with trade-offs between profit and stability, providing the decision maker with enhanced decision support.
   Conclusion: Multi-objective optimization with stability consideration for SPL scoping provides project managers with a robust and flexible way to address uncertainty in the process of SPL scoping. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The visualization of the Pareto optimal solution set is one of important issues of the multiobjective optimization. The Pareto optimal solution visualization method using the self-organizing maps is one of promising visualization methods. This method has two shortcomings. One is that the map size has to be determined in advance. The other is that infeasible solutions can appear in the learnt maps. This paper proposes a new visualization technique using the growing hierarchical SOM (GHSOM), which is expected to solve foregoing shortcomings. This paper also proposes to introduce a symmetric transformation of maps into the learning algorithm in order to obtain easily viewable unified map. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed through several numerical experiments.

AB The optimal allocation of distributed manufacturing resources is a challenging task for supply chain deployment in the current competitive and dynamic manufacturing environments, and is characterised by multiple objectives including time, cost, quality and risk that require simultaneous considerations. This paper presents an improved variant of the Teaching-Learning-Based Optimisation (TLBO) algorithm to concurrently evaluate, select and sequence the candidate distributed manufacturing resources allocated to subtasks comprising the supply chain, while dealing with the trade-offs among multiple objectives. Several algorithm-specific improvements are suggested to extend the standard form of TLBO algorithm, which is only well suited for the one-dimensional continuous numerical optimisation problem well, to solve the two-dimensional (i.e. both resource selection and resource sequencing) discrete combinatorial optimisation problem for concurrent allocation of distributed manufacturing resources through a focused trade-off within the constrained set of Pareto optimal solutions. The experimental simulation results showed that the proposed approach can obtain a better manufacturing resource allocation plan than the current standard meta-heuristic algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimisation and Harmony Search. Moreover, a near optimal resource allocation plan can be obtained with linear algorithmic complexity as the problem scale increases greatly.

AB The optimal design of buildings is a complex task involving energy systems as well as construction measures. Typically, in exact optimization models, only energy systems are considered, whereas envelope components are neglected. When considering both, heuristics are commonly used, which do not guarantee optimal or close to optimal results.
   Thus, this paper presents the governing equations, validation and exemplary usage of a building model suitable for exact optimization problems. The developed model simultaneously considers energy systems and building envelopes. It is based on ISO 13790 and validated according to ASHRAE 140 and further compared to a more detailed model. The findings show that the developed model largely complies with the ASHRAE requirements and is able to assess buildings' dynamic behavior regarding indoor air temperatures as well as hourly, peak load, and annual heating loads.
   The simultaneous optimization of energy system and envelope is further demonstrated analyzing retrofitting options of a residential building. We consider solely installing additional PV units, modernizing the building envelope according to German regulations and an optimization without constraints regarding building envelope and energy system. The results indicate that installing additional PV units can moderately reduce total costs and CO2 emissions. The envelope modernization according to governmental regulations leads to largely increased costs at lower emissions, whereas the unconstrained optimization is able to simultaneously achieve significant cost and CO2 emission advantages.

AB The test and operation characteristic of an organic Rankine cycle using R123 and a scroll expander have been investigated. The steady-state operation characteristic is addressed with the varying working fluid mass flow rates ranging of 0.124-0.222 kg/s and heat source temperatures ranging of 383.15-413.15 K. The behaviors and detailed discussion for those four major components (pump, evaporator, expander and condenser) are examined. The experimental results show that the environmental temperature presents a higher influence on the pump behaviors. The range of pump power consumption, isentropic efficiency and back work ratio are 0.21-0.32 kW, 26.76-53.96%, and 14-32%, respectively. The expander isentropic efficiency presents a slight decrease first and then a sharp increase with mass flow rate, while a degree of superheating more than 3 K is necessary to avoid expander cavitation. The expander isentropic and generator efficiencies are in range of 69.10-85.17% and 60-73%, respectively, while the respective heat transfer coefficients for evaporator and condenser are ranging of 200-400 and 450-2000 W/m(2) K. The maximum expander shaft power and electrical power are 2.78 kW and 2.01 kW, respectively, while the maximum system generating efficiency is 3.25%. Moreover, the tested thermal efficiency presents a slight decrease trend with mass flow rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Thermo-economic analysis is applied to four combined liquefied natural gas (LNG) cold energy and (1) simple, (2) with internal heat exchanger, (3) regenerative and (4) dual-fluid ORCs. These power plants use geothermal fluid energy as low-grade heat source and cold energy of LNG as thermal sink. Also, after vaporization in the organic fluid condenser, natural gas expands in a turbine to generate power. The effects of operating parameters on energy and exergy efficiencies as well as total annual cost rate are studied for the proposed systems. The operating parameters considered include inlet pressure of the organic fluid and natural gas turbines, condensing temperature of organic fluid, minimum temperature difference in evaporator, inlet temperature and mass flow rate of geothermal fluid. Moreover, optimal values of operating parameters of the system are evaluated to maximize the energy and exergy efficiencies and minimize the total product unit cost. The results show that the highest energy and exergy efficiencies are obtained for regenerative system and for the system with internal heat exchanger, respectively, while the simple system has the lowest total product cost. Furthermore, the maximum net power output is obtained using dual-fluid system at the same operating condition. Also, the higher and lower total cost rate in optimum performance condition belong to dual-fluid and regenerative systems, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Multiobjective short-term hydrothermal scheduling problems solved by the linear weighted sum method (LWSM) have multiple solutions with different weight coefficients. To compare the solutions of the formulated multiobjective hydrothermal model, we use the Charnes-Cooper-Rhodes (CCR) model of data envelopment analysis (DEA) to evaluate all solutions. A set of preference weight vectors is regarded as a decision-making unit (DMU), and the CCR model is employed with the minimal objective values as the inputs of DMU and the maximal objective values as outputs. Multiple reasonable solutions are obtained through the DEA efficiency of DMUs. Results of simulations imply that the method is feasible to get reasonable solutions in solving multiobjective hydrothermal scheduling problem with LWSM.

AB This paper provides a study on a novel octagonal multi-cell tube with functionally graded thickness (FGT) under multiple loading angles. First, comparative analysis on the FGT tube and the counterpart tube with uniform thickness(UT) under multiple loading angles reveal that the energy absorption is more superior for the FGT tube when the loading angle exceeds the lower bound of the transition range of the UT tube. Second, parametric study on the FGT tube indicates that thickness gradient exponent and thickness range have significant effect on its crashworthiness. Third, multiobjective optimizations of the FGT tube are conducted, aiming to maximize specific energy absorption(SEA) and minimize initial force(IPF) under multiple loading angles, based upon the Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm(NAGA-II) and RBF technique. The optimized FGT tube demonstrates better crashworthiness than the UT tube in all design cases. These findings can provide valuable guidelines for the design of multi-cell tube with functionally graded thickness under multiple loading angles.

AB In this study, Ti-1Al-1Mn thin foils with thickness of 0.05 mm were welded by small-scale resistance spot welding. Welding current, electrode force and welding time have been changed while other welding parameters remained constant. The welded joints were subjected to tensile shear tests for determining the values of shear force and absorption energy. A quadratic model of response surface methodology based on Box-Behnken design was employed in establishing regression equations between input variables (current, electrode force and time) and output variables (shear force, absorption energy, variance of shear force and variance of absorption energy). The models were satisfied in optimising the welding parameters. Besides, the microstructure analysis on the typical spot welds was also conducted.

AB Energy consumption of buildings accounts for more than 37.3% of total energy consumption while the proportion of energy-saving buildings is just 5% in China. In this paper, in order to save potential energy, the building envelope retrofitting is considered. An office building in Southern China was selected as a test example for energy consumption characteristics. The base building model was developed by TRNSYS software and validated against the recorded data from the field work in six days out of August-September in 2013. In addition, with a design of numerical simulation, sensitivity analysis was conducted for energy performance of building envelope retrofitting; six envelope parameters were analyzed for assessing the thermal responses. Results show that significant energy savings are obtained for the thermal transmittance (U-value) of exterior walls, infiltration rate, ventilation and shading coefficient, of which the sum relative sensitivity is about 91.06%. The results are evaluated in terms of energy and economic analysis. On the other hand, it appears that the cost-effective method improves the efficiency of investment management in building energy.

AB We present an approach to solve the nonconvex optimization problem that arises when designing the transmit covariance matrices in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast networks implementing simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). The MIMO SWIPT problem is formulated as a general multiobjective optimization problem, in which data rates and harvested powers are optimized simultaneously. Two different approaches are applied to reformulate the (nonconvex) multiobjective problem. In the first approach, the transmitter can control the specific amount of power to be harvested by power transfer whereas in the second approach the transmitter can only control the proportion of power to be harvested among the different harvesting users. We solve the resulting formulations using the majorization-minimization (MM) approach. The solution obtained from the MM approach is compared to the classical block-diagonalization (BD) strategy, typically used to solve the nonconvex multiuser MIMO network by forcing no interference among users. Simulation results show that the proposed approach improves over the BD approach both the system sum rate and the power harvested by users. Additionally, the computational times needed for convergence of the proposed methods are much lower than the ones required for classical gradient-based approaches.

These assets have been incrementally resourced, established, sited over the past 20 years without regard to the entire enterprise and, due to fiscal and political costs, modifications to the current structure must yield significant gains to garner approval. We formulate a multiobjective hierarchical extension of the maximal covering location problem that seeks to maximize coverage of the population within a rapid response window while minimizing modifications to the existing structure. Additionally, we prevent facilities from covering nodes located within close proximity using a modified conditional covering problem (CCP) constraint; this constraint accounts for the large impact radius that can occur in a worst-case scenario. To solve our multiobjective problem, we develop a set of non-inferior solutions using the epsilon-constraint method. These non-inferior solutions explicitly represent the trade-off between maximizing coverage and minimizing cost, and they offer a decision maker a set of Pareto optimal decisions to consider for implementation. Applying our model and methodology to the current set of assets, we demonstrate that, in the absence of resource constraints, we can improve coverage by more than 15%, approximately 49 million people. Furthermore, with only 23 unit relocations (less than a 30% modification of the entire structure) coverage can exceed 98%, an improvement of an additional 45 million people covered. Finally, we demonstrate additional advantages of implementing the modified CCP constraint. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A typical biorefining supply chain exerts substantial impact on the regional water resources. Indeed, a complex relationship exists between the production of biomass, the processing of biomass into fuels and chemicals, the usage of fresh water, and the discharge of wastewater. This paper introduces an optimization framework for the design of a biorefining system while accounting for the interactions with the surrounding watershed. Special attention is paid in the use of fresh water and the discharge of wastewater to the surrounded watershed. The optimization approach also accounts for the selection of feedstocks, location of cultivation sites and biomass processing facilities, and conversion technologies. Economic and environmental objectives are used. A case study for the central-west part of Mexico is presented. The results show that economic gains may be achieved while optimizing water usage and discharge and satisfying watershed constraints. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A significant amount of research has been done on bilevel optimization problems both in the realm of classical and evolutionary optimization. However, the multiobjective extensions of bilevel programming have received relatively little attention from researchers in both the domains. The existing algorithms are mostly brute-force nested strategies, and therefore computationally demanding. In this paper, we develop insights into multiobjective bilevel optimization through theoretical progress made in the direction of parametric multiobjective programming. We introduce an approximated set-valued mapping procedure that would be helpful in the development of efficient evolutionary approaches for solving these problems. The utility of the procedure has been emphasized by incorporating it in a hierarchical evolutionary framework and assessing the improvements. Test problems with varying levels of complexity have been used in the experiments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we present a variant of the vehicle routing problem (VRP) to increase security in the cash-in-transit sector. A specific index is used for quantifying the exposure of a vehicle to the risk of being robbed along its route. In addition, the problem is subject to a traditional capacity constraint, which limits the maximum amount of valuables that can be transported inside the vehicle. This constraint might be imposed, for example, by insurance companies. A biobjective formulation, aimed at reducing both risk and travel costs, is proposed. The objectives are conflicting since higher risk exposures would allow a reduction of the travel costs incurred by a transportation firm to visit all its customers for the collection of cash. A mathematical model of the problem is described and solved using a progressive multiobjective metaheuristic. Multiobjective optimization and multicriteria decision making are integrated into a single metaheuristic algorithm. To simplify the decision process, the decision maker's preferences are embedded into the multiobjective algorithm. Realistic instances are generated considering the geographical coordinates of several customers (e.g., stores, banks, shopping centers) located in Belgium. The proposed solution approach is tuned and tested both on these realistic instances and standard benchmark instances for the capacitated VRP.

AB This article studies the application of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms for solving the energy-aware scheduling problem of workflows in a distributed system that is composed by a federation of datacenters. Nowadays, energy efficiency is a major concern when using large distributed computing systems, including novel grid and cloud computing facilities. Researchers and system planners are looking for accurate methods to be used for planning the execution of large workloads that consume large amounts of resources, having a direct implications for the energy consumption of the system and its operational costs. In the approach proposed in this article, we study the application of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms combined with low-level backfilling heuristics for finding efficient mappings of workflows into resources in order to maximize several metrics related to the quality of service, while reducing the energy required for computation. The experimental evaluation is performed considering both medium and large workloads that model realistic high-performance computing applications and modern distributed computing infrastructures. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multiobjective evolutionary approaches compute accurate schedules, significantly outperforming both traditional round-robin/load-balancing schedulers and a set of combined list scheduling heuristics (accounting for both problem objectives) previously applied to the problem.

AB This study presents a metaheuristic based on a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to solve a biobjective mixed-integer nonlinear programming model for supply chain design with location-inventory decisions and supplier selection. The supply chain has four echelons with suppliers, plants, distribution centers, and retailers. The decision variables are the opening of plants and distribution centers and the flow of materials between the different facilities, considering a continuous review inventory policy. The conflicting objectives are to minimize total costs on the entire chain, and to maximize a combined value of overall equipment effectiveness from suppliers. Small- and medium-sized scenarios are solved and compared with Pareto fronts obtained with commercial optimization software applying the epsilon-constraint method. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed metaheuristic. The main contributions of this work are a new practical problem that has not been analyzed before, and the development of the evolutionary algorithm.

AB Optimal network design is a key factor in the enhancement of the economic, environmental, and social performance and efficiency of the biomass supply chain (BSC), and this is why it has become quite popular with the academia and practitioners. The great number of the related papers published in the scientific journals in recent years is the proof of the claim; therefore, to make a framework of the past works and specify the future directions, a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art papers deems necessary. The objective of this paper is to review the papers regarding the biomass supply chain network design (BSCND) models published in the scientific journals. A total number of 146 papers, published from Jan. 1997 to Jul. 2016 are reviewed, analyzed and classified based on their modeling approaches, decisions, uncertainties, solution methodologies, sustainability, model features, entities, data, and regions of the case studies. To determine the research opportunities and future directions, the gaps existing in the present literature have been clearly explained as well. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A metaheuristic technique for controller design is explored, and its performance is assessed for a real-world case. An evolutionary algorithm for self-tuning systems is proposed to tune the optimal control settings in order to achieve the best overall performance to control accurately the volume of natural gasoline in a storage tank. For high-level optimization, a flexible iterative technique based on Genetic Algorithms is presented. The algorithm is stable, and its architecture is simple, thus becoming easy to implement. Not only heuristics that produce superior solutions are taken into account, but also the computational speed is contemplated as a key factor. The experimental evaluation yields satisfactory fitness values, and relatively little computational effort is required.

AB Increasingly strict constraints on the boron concentration for safe drinking and irrigation water present a tremendous challenge for the design of seawater reverse osmosis (RO) desalination systems. This work presents an optimization study of a seawater reverse osmosis RO network with permeate split (PS) design under boron concentration restrictions. Front part permeates with better quality and higher flux are sent directly to the product, and back part permeates are reprocessed in pass 2 with high pH value. The irreversible thermodynamic model is employed to describe the membrane transport behavior of boron. Constraints for the system flow and operation conditions are added to guarantee safe operating of the RO system. Both single-product and two-product RO systems are optimized for different types of feed seawater. Results show that the PS design is mainly dominated by the boron constraints, while the system recovery is mainly controlled by the feed salt concentration. Due to the upper bound of pH for pass 2, PS design could be introduced for pass 2 to improve the boron rejection. For a two-product output system, the permeates from both RO pass 1 and pass 2 could be split and sent to different products. In general, PS design could offer lower water cost, lower energy consumption, and smaller system size compared with normal design. Not only the operation conditions but also the flow structure of the RO system should be adjusted according to both membrane fouling and degradation with time.

AB A Pareto-based multi-objective optimization approach has been proposed to design and obtain Paretooptimal set of solutions for performance and emission characteristics of a single cylinder, four stroke diesel engine using hydrogen in dual fuel mode. Instead of defining a single optimal objective, the proposed method establishes the multi-objective model by taking two design objectives into account, which are minimizing load (%) and hydrogen flow rate. To address this optimization problem, we develop a two-stage evolutionary computation approach integrating an exclusive non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution(TOPSIS). NSGA-II has been utilized to search for the candidate solutions in-terms of both objectives. The obtained results have been obtained as Pareto-front. Subsequently, the best compromise solution has been determined by the TOPSIS method from the Pareto-front according to the decision maker's preference. The design results shows that the proposed approach yields a remarkable reduction in the emission spectra with enhancement in performance of the engine under a single podium obtained by multi-objective optimization.

AB From cyanobacteria to human, sustained oscillations coordinate important biological functions. Although much has been learned concerning the sophisticated molecular mechanisms underlying biological oscillators, design principles linking structure and functional behavior are not yet fully understood. Here we explore design principles of biological oscillators from a multiobjective optimization perspective, taking into account the trade-offs between conflicting performance goals or demands. We develop a comprehensive tool for automated design of oscillators, based on multicriteria global optimization that allows two modes: (i) the automatic design (forward problem) and (ii) the inference of design principles (reverse analysis problem). From the perspective of synthetic biology, the forward mode allows the solution of design problems that mimic some of the desirable properties appearing in natural oscillators. The reverse analysis mode facilitates a systematic exploration of the design space based on Pareto optimality concepts. The method is illustrated with two case studies: the automatic design of synthetic oscillators from a library of biological parts, and the exploration of design principles in 3-gene oscillatory systems.

AB The study and the optimization of single devices, plants and integrated systems among producers and users, must be performed considering the possibility of energy storage and conversion among different forms of energy in order to reach the best overall energetic and environmental performance. Small CHP distributed plants are particularly interested in these challenges, both in stand-alone and grid-connected configurations. In this paper, the optimal design and management strategy of a trigeneration system composed by a PV plant, a diesel CHP engine, a reversible heat pump and a boiler is studied. The possibility of hybrid storage by means of a hot and a cold reservoirs, a pack of batteries, and a pumped hydro energy storage is investigated. By applying a model based on the Particle Swarm Optimization, the devices size and the operation strategy are simultaneously optimized. The most suitable devices' hourly based operation profile and the best management strategy of the energy storages are predicted. The minimization of the overall costs is the problem's optimization target, while the main constrain is the fulfillment of the users' request of electricity, heat, cooling and drinking water.

AB Due to problems, such as, heat losses of equipment, low energy efficiency, increasing pollution and the fossil fuels consumption, combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems have attracted lots of attention during the last decade. In this paper, for minimizing fossil fuel consumption and pollution, a novel CCHP system including photovoltaic (PV) modules, wind turbines, and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) as the prime movers is considered. Moreover, in order to minimize the excess electrical and heat energy production of the CCHP system and so reducing the need for the local power grid and any auxiliary heat production system, following electrical load (FEL) and following thermal load (FTL) operation strategies are considered, simultaneously. In order to determine the optimal number of each system component and also set the penalty factors in the used penalty function, a co-constrained multi objective particle swarm optimization (CC-MOPSO) algorithm is applied. Utilization of the renewable energy resources, the annual total cost (ATC) and the CCHP system area are considered as the objective functions. It also includes constraints such as, loss of power supply probability (LPSP), loss of heat supply probability (LHSP), state of battery charge (SOC), and the number of each CCHP component. A hypothetical hotel in Kermanshah, Iran is conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed system. 10 wind turbines, 430 PV modules, 11 SOFCs, 106 batteries and 2 heat storage tanks (HST) are numerical results for the spring as the best season in terms of decreasing cost and fuel consumption. Comparing the results of the system with a common separated production (SP) system shows that the fossil fuels consumption and the pollution can be reduced up to 263 and 353 times, respectively.

AB Coal-based power generation accounts for over two-fifths of global electricity supply and is supposed to be continuing its leading role in the coming decades. However, an integrated embodied energy accounting for typical coal-fired power system seems to be in its vacancy. To help erect a benchmark for energy analysis of electricity production, this study has for the first time established a complete inventory of energy inputs in the life cycle of a typical coal-fired power plant. Distinguished from previous works, with the support of ecological input output database, this paper gives full consideration to the energy embodied in materials, equipment and services that have been traditionally neglected. The indirect energy cost is illustrated to be a non-negligible component, sharing around one-tenth of the total. This work could be a reference example for holistic energy evaluation of power generation systems worldwide. In current context of energy conservation and emissions abatement, it is of significant importance as the retrofitting of power generation systems may initiate large amounts of indirect energy cost Besides, by calculating the nonrenewability indicator for the typical coal-fired power system, the energy saving potentials of several renewable alternatives are enunciated in this work. It may provide essential implications for policy makers in renewable deployment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biorefineries are increasingly important commercial facilities for the production of biofuels, biopower and various biomaterials from biomass with potentials to displace several existing industries currently based on polluting and finite fossil resources. Biorefinery systems consist of biorefinery facilities and their entire value chain. Integration of biorefinery systems aims at optimising the use of energies and materials in the total chain from biomass plantations to end product utilisation and is therefore capable of successfully improving economic viability and sustainability of biorefineries. Total Chain Integration can minimise capital and operating expenditures, maximise the quality, quantity and value of biorefinery bioproducts as well as minimise environmental impacts and maximise societal benefits. In order to efficiently perform Total Chain Integration advanced holistic software tools dedicated to biorefinery systems need to be developed.
   This review study systematically analyses Total Chain Integration of sustainable biorefinery systems. Existing knowledge is systematised by characterising system boundaries, principles, and integration methodologies. Further, approaches used in integration of biorefinery systems are defined and their implementation is briefly illustrated by case studies. Finally, state-of-the-art software tools for biorefinery integration are analysed and the requirements of a software tool for Total Chain Integration are provided.
   The review findings show that in order to develop truly economically viable and sustainable biorefinery systems tight integration is required. Essential integration approaches include integration of platforms, exchanging wastes and products with other industries, applying more efficient conversion routes, effective ways of enlarging feedstocks base, providing ecosystem and social services, and optimising biomass supply chain. Total Chain Integration requires software tools accounting for technical, economic, environmental and societal optimisation objectives within all system boundaries and the whole life cycle. The requirements of such software are proposed. Software enhanced Total Chain Integration has a potential to successfully achieve economic viability and sustainability of biorefinery systems in the business practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Reducing the energy consumption of a plant often conflicts with the investment required for heat recovery. This paper presents a design study of shell and tube heat exchanger and direct-contact heat exchanger in three retrofit configurations. Multiobjective optimizations are employed to find optimal solutions that increase exergy efficiency at justifiable costs. A numerical modelization of heat transfer equipements is developed using heat transfer, pressure drop and cost correlations from the open literature. In order to verify the capability of the proposed approach, a case study for heat recovery in a pulp and paper plant is presented. In which multiple structural modifications of existing heat recovery systems are proposed based on an analysis of the Grand Composite Curve pinch targeting method. Each proposed modification is subject to multiobjective optimization based on the fast non-dominant sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The case study's results shows significant steam operation cost reduction of up to 89% reducing exergy destruction by 82%. It has also been shown that for some heat recovery modifications the most cost effective solution is close to the minimum exergy destruction solution subject to equipment design constraints.

AB The increasing environmental concerns owing to the use of various engineering gadgets worldwide have posed a greater challenge for product designers, manufacturers, risk analysts and environmentalists in the design and development of various systems. In a system design environment, where sustainability risk assessment is the focus of the designer, the systematic consideration of sustainability risk during the conceptual design stage is a function of environmental impact of a system. This research paper presents a framework for sustainability risk assessment of a mechanical system at conceptual design stage. The system parameters are identified. These parameters are referred as Sustainability Risk Assessment parameters. Based on the parameters identified, the relationships among these parameters are also identified. These relationships are represented by means of a sustainability risk assessment graph. To avoid complexity of the graph while analyzing the system, it is represented by a matrix, which helps in developing the sustainability risk assessment expression. For analytical assessment, permanent risk function is obtained. Finally, an index is developed for evaluating various mechanical design systems from risk consideration. This framework will help designers while developing mechanical systems at conceptual design stage considering risk through sustainability. The proposed approach has been applied to a material selection case study. The relationships among various sustainability risk assessment parameters are established. Finally graph theory and matrix approach is applied for ranking of various design alternatives from sustainability risk assessment point of view. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nanoparticles volume fraction, mass flow rate of strong solution, low pressure of absorption section, collector tilt angle as well as solar collector area are selected as design parameters while the daily thermal and exergy coefficients of performance and total product cost rate are selected as three objective functions. Non dominated Sort Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is individually employed to achieve the final solutions of the system for the best working fluids from the thermodynamic and thermoeconomic viewpoints. The proposed system modeling represents that R134a is the best fluid from the energy and exergy viewpoints with daily energy and exergy coefficients of performance of 9340% and 0.5815%, respectively and R1234ze with the total product cost rate of 7016 $/year is the best working fluid from the exergoeconomic viewpoint. The optimization results indicate that R134a with 2.4% and 2% improvement of the daily energy and exergy coefficients of performance, respectively, relative to the base case needs minimum collector area with amount of 680 m(2) among the other working fluids. In addition, R1234ze with the total product cost rate reduction of 2.4% requires maximum nanoparticles and collector area with values of 0.041 and 702.01 m(2), respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB With the increasing use of on-line resources, the size of the bibliographic database is growing day by day. The available huge amount of data belong to various entities. It is difficult to automatically identify the records which belong to a particular entity. Mapping the records to the corresponding entity is termed as the entity matching problem. In bibliographic database many attributes change over time. For example - affiliation of an author changes frequently. Many authors generally use different email-ids. The names of co-authors also change with time. All these aspects have made the entity matching problem challenging. Generally an entity matching task is carried out by constructing a feature vector to represent a record, then a classifier is trained to classify each feature vector. But for bibliographic database it is very difficult and time consuming to generate some manually annotated labeled data to train a classifier. Inspired by this observation, we have proposed an unsupervised approach for entity matching problem using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). A new encoding strategy is used to encode the clusters in the form of a chromosome. New mutation and crossover operators are proposed which are suitable for bibliographic data clustering. Different distance measures are used to measure the dissimilarities between records. Finally, solutions are evolved using the search capability of NSGA-II. Experimental evaluations are carried out with 247 different combinations of eight objective functions for eight different bibliographic datasets. A comparative analysis with two existing systems - DBLP and ArnetMiner, shows that the proposed technique can produce better results in many cases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Drought stress is a major abiotic stress threatening plant and crop productivity. In case of fleshy fruits, understanding mechanisms governing water and carbon accumulations and identifying genes, QTLs and phenotypes, that will enable trade-offs between fruit growth and quality under Water Deficit (WD) condition is a crucial challenge for breeders and growers. In the present work, 117 recombinant inbred lines of a population of Solanum lycopersicum were phenotyped under control and WD conditions. Plant water status, fruit growth and composition were measured and data were used to calibrate a process-based model describing water and carbon fluxes in a growing fruit as a function of plant and environment. Eight genotype dependent model parameters were estimated using a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm in order to minimize the prediction errors of fruit dry and fresh mass throughout fruit development. WD increased the fruit dry matter content (up to 85%) and decreased its fresh weight (up to 60%), big fruit size genotypes being the most sensitive. The mean normalized root mean squared errors of the predictions ranged between 16-18% in the population. Variability in model genotypic parameters allowed us to explore diverse genetic strategies in response to WD. An interesting group of genotypes could be discriminated in which (i) the low loss of fresh mass under WD was associated with high active uptake of sugars and low value of the maximum cell wall extensibility, and (ii) the high dry matter content in control treatment (C) was associated with a slow decrease of mass flow. Using 501 SNP markers genotyped across the genome, a QTL analysis of model parameters allowed to detect three main QTLs related to xylem and phloem conductivities, on chromosomes 2, 4, and 8. The model was then applied to design ideotypes with high dry matter content in C condition and low fresh mass loss in WD condition. The ideotypes outperformed the RILs especially for large and medium fruit-size genotypes, by combining high pedicel conductance and high active uptake of sugars. Interestingly, five small fruit-size RILs were close to the selected ideotypes, and likely bear interesting traits and alleles for adaptation to WD.

AB The integration of large-scale renewable energy and demand response (DR) resources in smart grids have brought in emerging challenges for transmission expansion planning (TEP), particularly in terms of system security. The conventional TEP models have not fully addressed the cost and the feasibility of corrective control (CC) actions such as generation rescheduling and load curtailment under contingencies. Moreover, the optimality of CC depends on the pre-contingency state, the post-contingency state, as well as the existence and viability of the involved CC actions. In this study, first the authors have given the explicit definition of CC risk index (CCRI), which evaluates the expected system performance under a set of contingencies (i.e. risk of incurring security issues). With the authors' improvement, the CCRI is now mathematically tractable and may have wide applications to TEP problems. Afterwards, the authors have proposed a multi-objective TEP framework with tradeoffs between cost and risk. A relatively new yet superior multi-objective evolutionary algorithm called the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA)/D is introduced and employed to find Pareto optimal solutions. The proposed model is numerically verified on the modified IEEE RTS 24-bus and 118-bus systems. According to the simulation results, the proposed model can provide information regarding variants of risks and coordinate the optimum planning and DR solutions.

AB In this study, capacity allocation of demand-response (DR) and the real-time savings earned from implementing DR programmes (DRPs) are investigated based on a mixed integer non-linear multi-objective programming (MINMOP) framework according to two conflicting concepts, titled; maximum achievable potential (MAP) and realistic achievable potential (RAP). MAP indicates that placing a value on DR resources must be strictly weighed against the value of avoiding the acquisition of short-term resources to meet critical peak period, whereas RAP takes into accounts the amount of savings that might be achieved through DRPs. The proposed MINMOP includes both technical and economic aspects of integrating DRPs into the power systems by considering optimal generation scheduling cost, voltage drop, voltage stability margin, network loss, and incentive payment as objective functions. In addition, augmented -constraint method is applied to solve the proposed MINMOP by means of off-the-shelf conventional optimisation software. The IEEE 24-bus reliability test system (RTS 24-bus) is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. Eventually, DR allocation is analysed through four cases based on different number of candidate buses which demonstrate the interest and effectiveness of the proposed technique.

AB This study presents a new formulation for optimal power flow (OPF) to enhance the overall transient stability of the power system in addition to the traditional fuel cost minimisation. To overcome the shortcomings of the traditional formulation, this study formulates OPF as a true multi-objective optimisation problem. One objective is to operate the system economically within the system physical bounds. The other objective is to withstand severe contingencies by enhancing the system transient stability. To overcome the inconsistency and sub optimality problems, strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm is developed for solving multi-objective OPF (MOOPF) problem. Time domain simulations (TDSs) are employed for handling transient stability problem that knocks out the numerical inaccuracy and convergence problems. To speed up the transient stability assessment, a hybrid stability classifier is developed that combines TDS and transient energy function methods. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, two standard test systems have been considered. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach to solve the MOOPF and enhance greatly the system transient stability. The results also show the superiority of the proposed approach compared with those reported in the literature.

AB Sustainable building performance requires the integration of various metrics such as energy consumption, thermal comfort levels, occupants' wellbeing, and productivity. Despite their interdependence, these metrics have been mostly evaluated independently, overlooking potential tradeoffs that can occur between them (e.g., energy conservation efforts and thermal comfort). In addition, human-related factors such as occupants' energy consumption behaviors, schedules, and movements between buildings cannot be captured using current commercial building modeling tools. Consequently, simulating the performance of a group of buildings such as in a campus, neighborhood, or city remains very challenging. In this paper, a comprehensive agent-based modeling (ABM) framework is developed to: (1) model an urban area with several buildings along with the movements and actions of people within the environment; (2) calculate key performance metrics such as indoor/outdoor thermal comfort and energy consumption levels; and (3) test and propose strategies to optimize sustainable building operation. This study illustrates the multidisciplinary approach needed to capture various dimensions of sustainable building performance. The framework is then applied to a green campus environment, identifying an energy management strategy that can reduce energy consumption by 19% without compromising occupants' comfort and wellbeing.

AB Design criteria for a residential nZEB in Mediterranean climate are discussed. The integrated design procedure focuses on the problem of a large number of available building variants concerning the building envelope. The aim is to search the ones that minimize winter and summer energy demand without compromising thermal comfort.
   The adopted methodological approach combines the use of dynamic energy simulation tool (EnergyPlus), based on a one-dimensional conduction finite difference solution method, and a constrained multi-objective optimization algorithm. For four cities (Madrid, Nice, Naples, Athens), several passive strategies are compared: thermal properties of the building envelope, adoption of phase change materials with different melting temperatures, cool roof solutions, several window/wall ratio values, some external and internal shading systems. The results allow to evidence that it is difficult to understand the best trade-off between summer and winter performance, by assuring high standard of thermal comfort when the aim is to reach NZEB objectives in Mediterranean climate. However, some guidelines are indicated, starting from the discussed results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, an IBSOM (inexact bi-level simulation-optimization model) is developed for conjunctive regional renewable energy planning and air pollution control for EPS (electric power systems) under uncertainty. The IBSOM integrates techniques of CFMTVW (combined forecasting model with time varying weights), ILP (interval linear programming), MIP (mixed integer programming), CCP (chance constrained programming), as well as BLP (bi-level programming) into a general framework. In the IBSOM, uncertainties expressed as interval and stochastic parameters within multi-period and multi option contexts can be effectively tackled. In addition, a leader-follower decision strategy is incorporated into the optimization process where two non-competitive objectives are sequentially proposed, with the environmental sector dominating the upper-level objective (leader's one) and the energy sector providing the lower-level objective (follower's one). To solve the proposed model, an improved bi-level interactive solution algorithm based on satisfactory degree is introduced into the decision-making process for balancing to what extent the constraints are met and the objective reaches its optima. Then, the IBSOM is applied to a real-world case study of EPS in Fengtai District, Beijing, China. Interval solutions associated with renewable energy development, electricity generation, facility-expansion scheme, as well as pollutants mitigation can be obtained under different system-violation risk. Results indicate that a higher violation risk would lead to a decreased strictness of the constraints or an expanded decision space, which results in the decreased system cost and pollutant emissions, but increases system risk. Conversely, a lower violation risk would correspond to a lower probability of system-constraint violation, then to higher system cost and more pollutant emissions, but the risk of violating the constraints would be decreased. These variations can enable Stakeholders to coordinate the conflict interactions among system cost, pollutants mitigation, and system-violation risk under multiple uncertainties. Moreover, the performance of the IBSOM is enhanced by comparing with single-level models. Results demonstrate that the IBSOM can promote much more mutual influences and restrictions between the twofold decision makers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The energy industry is striving for cost-efficient production with low emissions. The efficiency of energy conversion processes is one of the most important factors affecting the path to such a goal. This paper provides a framework for the monitoring of steam boiler operation in power stations. The framework is based on the use of historical process data as a reference for real-time operation. The actual boiler efficiency is monitored together with its expected efficiency, which is an estimate of the highest historical efficiency in the corresponding process state, based on a data-driven model. In the presented approach, the process state is defined on the basis of variables that have the strongest correlation with boiler efficiency according to information-theoretic variable ranking. Boiler performance is monitored using a statistical process control chart for the difference between the expected and actual efficiencies. The framework was tested using data from a circulating fluidised bed boiler and from a corner-fired boiler. The results revealed that the strongest correlations between process variables and boiler efficiency are substantially consistent in both cases. Moreover, the framework provides a novel measure for boiler performance enhancement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB One of the main concerns in designing and operating data centers is the significant energy consumption of the cooling systems. Over the past years, developing and applying more energy efficient cooling strategies to reduce the environmental footprint and the total cost of ownership of data centers has drawn considerable attention. Cooling systems with air-side economizer cycle provide one of the most efficient methods. Their effectiveness in terms of energy and exergy, and the environmental and economical impact have been analyzed quantitatively in this research. Since the effectiveness highly depends on the local climate conditions, the analysis has been carried out for 23 locations across Australia. First, a detailed cooling load of the data center has been estimated by considering the workload and heat generation characteristics of the running IT equipment. Then, a comprehensive energy, exergy, environment and economic model of nine different air-side economizer cycles has been developed. Finally, the effectiveness and profitability of each economizer cycle has been compared to a conventional cooling system by evaluating the annual and monthly saving potential at each location. The air-side economizers can yield maximum savings of 84%, 80%, 75% and 85% in the annual cooling energy consumption, exergy destruction, CO2 emission and cooling costs, respectively. The power usage effectiveness (PUE) of the data centers can be also reduced from an average of 1.42 to 1.22. These savings and efficiency enhancements are highly correlated with the type and geographic location of the air-side economizers. In general, the saving potential increases as we move further south in Australia, due to more favorable climate conditions. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the future real-time optimization of reconfigurable radar transmitter power amplifiers, a typical optimization would seek the highest power-added efficiency (PAE) possible under constraints on adjacent-channel power ratio and delivered power. This paper describes a sequential, fast optimization algorithm to find the constrained optimum using experimental queries taken at sequentially selected load reflection-coefficient values. The algorithm is compared across multiple starting reflection-coefficient values on the Smith chart and convergence to similar constrained optimum impedances and PAE values is demonstrated in both simulation and measurement. This algorithm is designed to allow reconfigurable radar transmitter amplifiers to optimize in real-time, meeting dynamically changing spectral mask, power efficiency, and output power requirements.

AB The construction of bridges has been necessary for societies since ancient times, when the communication between and within towns, cities or communities was established. Until recently, the economic factor has been the only one considered in the decision-making of any type of construction process for bridges. However, nowadays, the objective should not be just the construction of bridges, but of sustainable bridges. Economic, social and environmental factors, which form the three pillars of sustainability, have been recently added. These three factors usually have conflicting perspectives. The decision-making process allows the conversion of a judgment into a rational procedure to reach a compromise solution. The aim of this paper is to review different methods and sustainable criteria used for decision-making at each life-cycle phase of a bridge, from design to recycling or demolition. This paper examines 77 journal articles for which different methods have been used. The most used methods are briefly described. In addition, a statistical study was carried out on the Multiple Attribute Decision-making papers reviewed.

AB Rotor airfoil design is investigated in this paper. There are many difficulties for this high-dimensional multi-objective problem when traditional multi-objective optimization methods are used. Therefore, a multi-layer hierarchical constraint method is proposed by coupling principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction and e-constraint method to translate the original high-dimensional problem into a bi-objective problem. This paper selects the main design objectives by conducting PCA to the preliminary solution of original problem with consideration of the priority of design objectives. According to the e-constraint method, the design model is established by treating the two top-ranking design goals as objective and others as variable constraints. A series of bi-objective Pareto curves will be obtained by changing the variable constraints, and the favorable solution can be obtained by analyzing Pareto curve spectrum. This method is applied to the rotor airfoil design and makes great improvement in aerodynamic performance. It is shown that the method is convenient and efficient, beyond which, it facilitates decision-making of the high-dimensional multi-objective engineering problem.

AB With the deep integration of information and communication technology, the network performance of existing switched Ethernet cannot meet the growing control and management demands of the industrial production. To solve the time-delay and sub-network transmission balance problem, a multiobjective nondominated sorting genetic algorithm based on mapping matrix is proposed, in which a new topology model is established to reflect the flexible Ethernet topology format. Meanwhile, an adjacency mapping matrix is introduced as genetic code to embody the actual topology structure and several special properties of the mapping matrix caused by the industrial topology characteristics are proved. On the basis of these properties, an asexual crossover and double swap mutation operation is proposed to achieve the population evolution. Besides, in the genetic procedure of the proposed algorithm a self-adaptive measure and an elite reservation strategy are applied to accelerate the convergence speed. The validity of proposed algorithm is demonstrated by benchmark test and the case verification shows that the comprehensive performance of the switched Ethernet is improved.

AB We propose an approach for computing the end-to-end delay bound of individual variable bit-rate flows in an First Input First Output multiplexer with aggregate scheduling under weighted round robin (WRR) policy. To this end, we use a network calculus to derive per-flow end-to-end equivalent service curves employed for computing least upper delay bounds (LUDBs) of the individual flows. Since the real-time applications are going to meet guaranteed services with lower delay bounds, we optimize the weights in WRR policy to minimize the LUDBs while satisfying the performance constraints. We formulate two constrained delay optimization problems, namely, minimize-delay and multiobjective optimization. Multiobjective optimization has both the total delay bounds and their variance as the minimization objectives. The proposed optimizations are solved using a genetic algorithm. A video object plane decoder case study exhibits a 15.4% reduction of the total worst case delays and a 40.3% reduction on the variance of delays when compared with round robin policy. The optimization algorithm has low run-time complexity, enabling quick exploration of the large design spaces. We conclude that an appropriate weight allocation can be a valuable instrument for the delay optimization in on-chip network designs.

AB A diversity of multiresponse optimization methods has been introduced in the literature; however, their performance has not been thoroughly explored, and only a classical desirability-based criterion has been commonly used. With the aim of contributing to help practitioners in selecting an effective criterion for solving multiresponse optimization problems developed under the response surface methodology framework, and thus to find compromise solutions that are technically and economically more favorable, the working ability of several easy-to-use criteria is evaluated and compared with that of a theoretically sound method. Four case studies with different numbers and types of responses are considered. Less-sophisticated criteria were able to generate solutions similar to those generated by sophisticated methods, even when the objective is to depict the Pareto frontier in problems with conflicting responses. Two easy-to-use criteria that require less-subjective information from the user yielded solutions similar to those of a classical desirability-based criterion. Preference parameters range and increment impact on optimal solutions were also evaluated.

AB By-product synergy is a growing practice worldwide. It consists in the maximization of resources utilization with the replacement of raw materials by by-products as inputs for industrial processes. In order to support decision making in such strategic projects, appropriate tools must be developed. This article presents the results of a research project, which includes the development of a multiobjective mathematical programming model for the optimization of by-product flows, synergy configurations, and investment decisions in eco-industrial networks. This model is evaluated using data related to the Kalundborg industrial symbiosis (IS) in order to illustrate its utilization, as well as to assess, in a retrospective manner, the behavior of the companies involved with respect to both economic and environmental benefits of synergies. The experiments also illustrate the influence of the municipality on synergy implementation and how a scenario-based approach can be used to anticipate raw material price increase. The results are generally coherent with the actual timing of synergy initializations. Further, the considerable effect of water price on the length of investments' payback period illustrates the impact of policies and regulations on IS.

AB In this paper, the modeling of developers' assignment to bugs (DAB) is studied. The problem is modeled both as a single objective (minimize bug fix time) and as a bi-objective (minimize bug fix time and cost) combinatorial optimization problem. Two models of developer assignment are considered where in the first model a single developer is assigned per bug (single developer model), while in the second model a single developer is assigned for each competency area of a bug (individual competency model). The latter model is proposed in this paper. For the single developer model, GA@DAB, an existing genetic algorithm-based approach, is extended to support precedence among bugs. For the individual competency model of DAB, one genetic algorithm-based approach (Competence@DAB) and one nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II-based approach (CompetenceMulti2@DAB) are proposed to generate solutions minimizing time and minimizing both time and cost, respectively. The performance of the proposed approaches was evaluated for 2040 bugs of 19 open-source milestone projects from the ECLIPSE platform. Our results and analysis show that the proposed individual competency model is far better than the single developer model, with average bug fix time reduction of 39.7% across all projects.

AB Planning Support Systems (PSS) comprise a wide variety of geo-technological tools related to GIS and spatial modeling aimed at addressing land planning processes. This article describes the OpenRules system, a PSS based on a previous system called RULES. Among OpenRules new features are its architecture, based exclusively on free and open source software, and its applicability to all land use types, including rural and urban uses. In addition, OpenRules incorporates an unlimited number of land evaluation factors and a new objective in land use spatial allocation. OpenRules has been programmed in Java and implemented as a module of the free GIS software gvSIG, with full integration between the GIS and the decision support tools. Decision support tools include multicriteria evaluation, multiobjective linear programming and heuristic techniques, which support three basic stages of land use planning processes, namely land suitability evaluation, land use area optimization and land use spatial allocation. The application of OpenRules to the region of La Troncal, Ecuador, demonstrates its capability to generate alternative and coherent solutions through a scientific and justified procedure at low cost in terms of time and resources.

AB Biofuels provide an attractive alternative for satisfying energy demands in a more sustainable way than fossil fuels. To establish a biorefinery, an optimal plan must be implemented for the entire associated supply chain, covering such aspects as selection of feedstocks, location, and capacity of biorefineries, selection of processing technologies, production amounts and transportation flows. In this context, there are several parameters, including the availability of biomass, product demand, and product prices, which are difficult to predict because they might change drastically over the different seasons of the year as well as across years. To address this challenge, this work presents a mathematical programming model for the optimal planning of a distributed system of biorefineries that considers explicitly the uncertainty associated with the supply chain operation as well as the associated risk. The potential of the proposed approach is demonstrated through its application to the production of biofuels in Mexico, considering multiple raw materials and products.

AB This study performed evaluations of the shell and helically-coiled tube heat exchangers with various dimple arrangements, that is, flat, inline, staggered, and bulged, at different Dean numbers (De) and inlet temperatures of a hot channel. Conjugated heat transfer was analyzed to evaluate the heat transfer performance of the exchangers through temperature difference between the inlet and outlet, Nusselt number inside the coiled tube, and pressure drop of the coiled tube by using 3-D Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations with shear stress transport turbulence closure. A grid dependency test was performed to determine the optimal number of the grid system. The numerical results were validated using the experimental data, and showed good agreement. The inline and staggered arrangements show the highest temperature differences through all De. The staggered arrangement shows the best heat transfer performance, whereas the inline arrangement shows the second highest performance with all ranges of De and the hot channel's inlet temperature. The inline and staggered arrangements show the highest pressure drop among all inlet temperatures of the hot channel.

AB Gene expression data are usually redundant, and only a subset of them presents distinct profiles for different classes of samples. Thus, selecting high discriminative genes from gene expression data has become increasingly interesting in bioinformatics. In this paper, a multiobjective binary differential evolution method (MOBDE) is proposed to select a small subset of informative genes relevant to the classification. In the proposed method, firstly, the Fisher-Markov selector is used to choose top features of gene expression data. Secondly, to make differential evolution suitable for the binary problem, a novel binary mutation method is proposed to balance the exploration and exploitation ability. Thirdly, the multiobjective binary differential evolution is proposed by integrating the summation of normalized objectives and diversity selection into the binary differential evolution algorithm. Finally, the MOBDE algorithm is used for feature selection, and support vector machine (SVM) is used as the classifier with the leave-one-out cross-validation method (LOOCV). In order to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm, the proposed method is tested on ten gene expression datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is very effective.

AB This article introduces a framework for the multi-criteria satisfaction assessment of the spatial distribution of urban emergency shelters. A GIS-based analytic hierarchy process approach was utilized to conduct the assessment based on selected criteria layers for daytime and nighttime scenarios, respectively. The layers were generated from high-precision land use data based on high-resolution aerial images and census data. Considering the uncertainty in criteria weighting, a spatial sensitivity analysis was undertaken for deriving more accurate results. The feasibility of the framework was tested on a case study in Jing'an District, Shanghai, China. The assessment results show that both at nighttime and during daytime, even if all potentially available shelters are open, the demand in large areas can only be marginally satisfied or not satisfied, especially in the northern, eastern, and central parts of Jing'an District. The quantitative analysis of the satisfaction conditions of the buildings or land parcels and the affected people, especially children and the elderly, shows a low satisfaction level of shelter services in these areas. The satisfaction assessment of emergency shelters can help government decision makers find low satisfaction areas of sheltering services and support further location-allocation optimization of urban emergency shelters.

AB In recent years, access to freight transportation capacity has become a constant issue in the minds of logistics managers due to capacity shortages. In a buyer-seller relationship, reliable, timely, and cost-effective access to transportation is critical to the success of such partnerships. Given this, guaranteed capacity contracts with third-party logistics providers (3PLs) may be appealing to shippers to increase their access to capacity and respond effectively to customer requirements. With this new opportunity, 3PLs must focus on approaches that can assist them in analyzing their options as they promise guaranteed capacity to shippers when faced with uncertain demand and related risks in transportation. In this paper, we analytically analyze three capacity-based risk mitigation strategies and the mixed use of these individual strategies using industry-based data to provide insights on which strategy is preferable to the 3PL and under what conditions. We posit that the selection of a strategy is contingent on several conditions faced by both the shipper and the carrier. Although our approach is analytical in nature, it has a high degree of practical utility in that a 3PL can utilize our decision models to effectively analyze and visualize the trade-offs between the different strategies by considering appropriate cost and demand data.

AB Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an essential differentiation program during tissue morphogenesis and remodeling. EMT is induced by soluble transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) family members, and restricted by vascular endothelial growth factor family members. While many downstream molecular regulators of EMT have been identified, these have been largely evaluated individually without considering potential crosstalk. In this study, we created an ensemble of dynamic mathematical models describing TGF-beta induced EMT to better understand the operational hierarchy of this complex molecular program. We used ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the transcriptional and post-translational regulatory events driving EMT. Model parameters were estimated from multiple data sets using multiobjective optimization, in combination with cross-validation. TGF-beta exposure drove the model population toward a mesenchymal phenotype, while an epithelial phenotype was enhanced following vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) exposure. Simulations predicted that the transcription factors phosphorylated SP1 and NFAT were master regulators promoting or inhibiting EMT, respectively. Surprisingly, simulations also predicted that a cellular population could exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity (characterized by a significant fraction of the population with both high epithelial and mesenchymal marker expression) if treated simultaneously with TGF-beta and VEGF-A. We tested this prediction experimentally in both MCF10A and DLD1 cells and found that upwards of 45% of the cellular population acquired this hybrid state in the presence of both TGF-beta and VEGF-A. We experimentally validated the predicted NFAT/Sp1 signaling axis for each phenotype response. Lastly, we found that cells in the hybrid state had significantly different functional behavior when compared to VEGF-A or TGF-beta treatment alone. Together, these results establish a predictive mechanistic model of EMT susceptibility, and potentially reveal a novel signaling axis which regulates carcinoma progression through an EMT versus tubulogenesis response.

AB A two-stage optimization method for optimal dynamic design of planar mechanisms is presented in this paper. For dynamic balancing, minimization of the shaking force and the shaking moment is achieved by finding optimum mass distribution of mechanism links using the equimomental system of point-masses in the first stage of the optimization. In the second stage, their shapes are synthesized systematically by closed parametric curve, i.e. cubic B-spline curve corresponding to the optimum inertial parameters found in the first stage. The multi-objective optimization problem to minimize both the shaking force and the shaking moment is solved using evolutionary optimization algorithm - "Teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm''. The computational performance of TLBO algorithm is compared with another evolutionary optimization algorithm, i.e. genetic algorithm.

AB Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are robust stochastic optimisers that perform well over a wide range of problems. Their robustness, however, may be affected by several adjustable parameters, such as mutation rate, crossover rate, and population size. Algorithm parameters are usually problem-specific, and often have to be tuned not only to the problem but even the problem instance at hand to achieve ideal performance. In addition, research has shown that different parameter values may be optimal at different stages of the optimisation process. To address these issues, researchers have shifted their focus to adaptive parameter control, in which parameter values are adjusted during the optimisation process based on the performance of the algorithm. These methods redefine parameter values repeatedly based on implicit or explicit rules that decide how to make the best use of feedback from the optimisation algorithm.
   In this survey, we systematically investigate the state of the art in adaptive parameter control. The approaches are classified using a new conceptual model that subdivides the process of adapting parameter values into four steps that are present explicitly or implicitly in all existing approaches that tune parameters dynamically during the optimisation process. The analysis reveals the major focus areas of adaptive parameter control research as well as gaps and potential directions for further development in this area.

AB In this article, a methodology for the sizing and analysis of fuel cell/supercapacitor hybrid vehicles is presented. The proposed sizing methodology is based on the fulfilment of power requirements, including sustained speed tests and stochastic driving cycles. The procedure to generate driving cycles is also presented in this paper. The sizing algorithm explicitly accounts for the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS). The performance is compared with optimal consumption, which is found using an off-line strategy via Dynamic Programming. The sizing methodology provides guidance for sizing the fuel cell and the supercapacitor number. The results also include analysis on oversizing the fuel cell and varying the parameters of the energy management strategy. The simulation results highlight the importance of integrating sizing and energy management into fuel cell hybrid vehicles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A third-order numerical model based on one-dimensional computational fluid dynamics is developed for kinetic Stirling engines. Various loss mechanisms in Stirling engines, including gas spring hysteresis loss, shuttle loss, appendix displacer gap loss, gas leakage loss, finite speed loss, piston friction loss, pressure drop loss, heat conduction loss, mechanical loss and imperfect heat transfer, are considered and embedded into the basic control equations. The non-equilibrium thermal model is adopted for the regenerator to capture the oscillating features of the gas and solid temperatures. To improve the numerical stability and accuracy, the implicit second-order time difference scheme and the second-order upwind scheme are adopted for discretizing the time differential terms and convective terms, respectively. Experimental validations are then conducted on a beta-type Stirling engine with the extensive experimental data for diverse working conditions. The results show that the developed model has better accuracies than the previous second-order models. Good agreements are achieved for predicting various critical system parameters, including pressure-volume diagram, indicated power, brake power, indicated efficiency, brake efficiency and mechanical efficiency. In particular, both the experiments and simulations show that the Stirling engine charged with helium tends to have much lower optimal working frequencies and poorer performances compared to the hydrogen system. Based on the analyses of the losses, it reveals that the pressure drop in the flow channels plays a critical role in shaping the different behaviors. The pressure drop in the helium system is much larger and more sensitive to the frequency increase due to the much larger viscosity of gaseous helium. Hydrogen is a superior working gas for a Stirling engine. The transient characteristics of the oscillating flow and the associated thermal interactions between gas and solid in the regenerator are finally analyzed in order to have an insight of the complex thermodynamic process. The study provides a promising numerical approach in simulating Stirling engines for further understandings of their operating characteristics and the underling mechanisms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Distributed generation (DG) systems install communication networks for managing real-time energy imbalance. Different from previous research, which typically assumes perfect communication networks, this work aims to quantitatively account for the impact of degraded communication networks on DG systems performance. The degraded behavior of communication networks is modeled by stochastic continuous time transmission delays and packet dropouts. On the DG systems side, we consider the inherent uncertainties of renewable energy sources, loads and energy prices. We develop a Monte Carlo simulation-optimal power flow (MCS-OPF) computational framework that is capable of generating consecutive time-dependent operating scenarios of the integrated system. Quantitative analysis is carried out to measure the impact of communication networks degradation onto the DG systems. For illustration, the framework is applied to a modified IEEE 13 nodes test feeder. The results demonstrate that the degraded communication networks can significantly deteriorate the performance of the integrated system. A grey differential model-based prediction method for reconstructing missing data is effective in mitigating the influence of the degraded communication networks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, an integrated multi-objective production-distribution flow-shop scheduling problem will be taken into consideration with respect to two objective functions. The first objective function aims to minimize total weighted tardiness and make-span and the second objective function aims to minimize the summation of total weighted earliness, total weighted number of tardy jobs, inventory costs and total delivery costs. Firstly, a mathematical model is proposed for this problem. After that, two new meta-heuristic algorithms are developed in order to solve the problem. The first algorithm (HCMOPSO), is a multi-objective particle swarm optimization combined with a heuristic mutation operator, Gaussian membership function and a chaotic sequence and the second algorithm (HBNSGA-II), is a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II with a heuristic criterion for generation of initial population and a heuristic crossover operator. The proposed HCMOPSO and HBNSGA-II are tested and compared with a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), a Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) and two state-of-the-art algorithms from recent researches, by means of several comparing criteria. The computational experiments demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed HCMOPSO and HBNSGA-II. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multi-objective layout optimization methods for the conceptual design of robot cellular manufacturing systems are proposed in this paper. Robot cellular manufacturing systems utilize one or more flexible robots which can carry out a large number of operations, and can conduct flexible assemble processes. The layout design stage of such manufacturing systems is especially important since fundamental performances of the manufacturing system under consideration are determined at this stage. Layout area, operation time and manipulability of robot are the three important criteria when it comes to designing manufacturing system. The use of nature inspired algorithms are not extensively explored to optimize robot workcell layouts. The contribution in this paper is the use of five nature-inspired algorithms, viz. genetic algorithm (GA), differential evolution (DE), artificial bee colony (ABC), charge search system (CSS) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms and to optimize the three design criteria simultaneously. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II is used to handle multiple objectives and to obtain pareto solutions for the problems considered. The performance of sequence pair and B*-Tree layout representation schemes are also evaluated. It is found that sequence pair scheme performs better than B*-Tree representation and it is used in the algorithms. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed methods. It is observed that PSO performs better over the other algorithms in terms of solution quality.

AB Cache memory optimization has an important impact on the energy consumption of the embedded system. However, optimization is a hard task due to the large exploration space and conflicting objectives. In this work five multiobjective optimization techniques are applied to cache memory optimization. The PESA-II, NSGAII, SPEA2, PAES and NPGA approaches were applied to 18 different applications from MiBench and PowerStone benchmark suites. Results compared the quality of results in terms of the metrics of general distance, diversity, hypervolume and precision. All techniques had good performance to cache optimization, but PESA-II showed a better performance for all metrics analyzed, having better results in 83% and 88% of cases, compared with the metrics of generational distance and hypervolume, respectively. Additionally, PESA-II needs to explore only 1.47% of exploration space, finding solutions near to Pareto Optimal. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Software configuration, which aims to customize the software for different users (e.g., Linux kernel configuration), is an important and complicated task. In software product line engineering (SPLE), feature oriented domain analysis is adopted and feature model is used to guide the configuration of new product variants. In SPLE, product configuration is an optimal feature selection problem, which needs to find a set of features that have no conflicts and meanwhile achieve multiple design objectives (e.g., minimizing cost and maximizing the number of features). In previous studies, several multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) were used for the optimal feature selection problem and indicator-based evolutionary algorithm (IBEA) was proven to be the best MOEA for this problem. However, IBEA still suffers from the issues of correctness and diversity of found solutions. In this paper, we propose a dual-population evolutionary algorithm, named IBED, to achieve both correctness and diversity of solutions. In IBED, two populations are individually evolved with two different types of evolutionary operators, i.e., IBEA operators and differential evolution (DE) operators. Furthermore, we propose two enhancement techniques for existing MOEAs, namely the feedback-directed mechanism to fast find the correct solutions (e.g., solutions that satisfy the feature model constraints) and the preprocessing method to reduce the search space. Our empirical results have shown that IBED with the enhancement techniques can outperform several state-of-the-art MOEAs on most case studies in terms of correctness and diversity of found solutions.

AB Deriving products from a Feature Model (FM) for testing Software Product Lines (SPLs) is a hard task. It is important to select a minimum number of products but, at the same time, to consider the coverage of testing criteria such as pairwise, among other factors. To solve such problems Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have been successfully applied. However, to design a solution for this and other software engineering problems can be very difficult, because it is necessary to choose among different search operators and parameters. Hyper-heuristics can help in this task, and have raised interest in the Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) field. Considering the growing adoption of SPL in the industry and crescent demand for SPL testing approaches, this paper introduces a hyper-heuristic approach to automatically derive products to variability testing of SPLs. The approach works with MOEAs and two selection methods, random and based on FRR-MAB (Fitness Rate Rank based Multi-Armed Bandit). It was evaluated with real FMs and the results show that the proposed approach outperforms the traditional algorithms used in the literature, and that both selection methods present similar performance.

AB Software product line (SPL) development is a new approach to software engineering which aims at the development of a whole range of products. However, as long as SPL can be useful, there are many challenges regarding the use of that approach. One of the main problems which hinders the adoption of software product line (SPL) is the complexity regarding product management. In that context, we can remark the scoping problem. One of the existent ways to deal with scoping is the product portfolio scoping (PPS). PPS aims to define the products that should be developed as well as their key features. In general, that approach is driven by marketing aspects, like cost of the product and customer satisfaction. Defining a product portfolio by using the many different available aspects is a NP-hard problem. This work presents an improved hybrid approach to solve the feature model selection problem, aiming at supporting product portfolio scoping. The proposal is based in a hybrid approach not dependent on any particular algorithm/technology. We have evaluated the usefulness and scalability of our approach using one real SPL (ArgoUML-SPL) and synthetic SPLs. As per the evaluation results, our approach is both useful from a practitioner's perspective and scalable. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this work is to numerically find the optimum location of constant potential anodes to ensure complete structure surface protection using a cathodic protection technique. The existence of sacrificial anodes is originally introduced through the boundary conditions of the corresponding boundary value problem (BVP). However, if constant potential galvanic regions are introduced through its boundaries, then finding their optimal location is not an easy task due to the necessity of redefining boundary geometric nodes and the arrangement of virtual sources for the standard method of fundamental solutions (MFS) formulation. Therefore, in this work, the galvanic anodes are introduced as source terms using a Gaussian function. Hence, the boundary remains the same for different anode positions. The optimization process includes the identification of the following parameters characterizing the Gaussian function: the optimum coordinates of the centre of the anode, a factor that involves the inherent potential of the electrode and a proportionality factor for the electrode diameter. The MFS methodology coupled with a genetic algorithm presented good results for this multiobjective optimization procedure. This fact can be seen in the several results of applications that are discussed in this paper, considering numerical simulations in finite regions in R-2. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper discusses how a mobility model can be used jointly with a mobile activity trace and evolutionary computation to reduce the signaling load related to mobility management, an important and fundamental task in any public land mobile network. For this purpose, a mobility model is used to determine the most probable locations of each mobile subscriber, and this information, in turn, is used to assign paging areas. This paging strategy is evaluated by taking into account different probability thresholds and time-delay constraints, and in a multiobjective way. Thus, we study the whole objective space of the problem, ensure the results that are not dependent on the configuration of registration areas used in the analysis, and take into account the signaling traffic of both paging and location updates (in contrast to other published works, in which only the reduction in the paging load is considered). The feasibility of this paging scheme is evaluated by means of a performance analysis, in which it is compared with other paging schemes widely used in the recent literature. Results show that this paging strategy can reduce the blanket paging load by an average of similar to 56.73%. Furthermore, the performance analysis also shows that using evolutionary computation jointly with a paging procedure based on a mobility model is a very useful strategy for managing mobility in a public land mobile network, because it allows the total signaling load obtained by blanket paging to be reduced by similar to 67.03%.

AB Spectral unmixing is an important technique for exploiting hyperspectral data. The presence of nonlinear mixing effects poses an important problem when attempting to provide accurate estimates of the abundance fractions of pure spectral components (endmembers) in a scene. This problem complicates the development of algorithms that can address all types of nonlinear mixtures in the scene. In this paper, we develop a new strategy to simultaneously estimate both the endmember signatures and their corresponding abundances using a biswarm particle swarm optimization (BiPSO) bilinear unmixing technique based on Fan's model. Our main motivation in this paper is to explore the potential of the newly proposed bilinearmixture model based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) for nonlinear spectral unmixing purposes. By taking advantage of the learning mechanism provided by PSO, we embed a multiobjective optimization technique into the algorithm to handle the more complex constraints in simplex volume minimization algorithms for spectral unmixing, thus avoiding limitations due to penalty factors. Our experimental results, conducted using both synthetic and real hyperspectral data, demonstrate that the proposed BiPSO algorithm can outperform other traditional spectral unmixing techniques by accounting for nonlinearities in the mixtures present in the scene.

ID DEFECT PREDICTION; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM
AB Many change classification techniques have been proposed to identify defect-prone changes. These techniques consider all developers' historical change data to build a global prediction model. In practice, since developers have their own coding preferences and behavioral patterns, which causes different defect patterns, a separate change classification model for each developer can help to improve performance. Jiang, Tan, and Kim refer to this problem as personalized change classification, and they propose PCC+ to solve this problem. A software project has a number of developers; for a developer, building a prediction model not only based on his/her change data, but also on other relevant developers' change data can further improve the performance of change classification. In this paper, we propose a more accurate technique named collective personalized change classification (CPCC), which leverages a multiobjective genetic algorithm. For a project, CPCC first builds a personalized prediction model for each developer based on his/her historical data. Next, for each developer, CPCC combines these models by assigning different weights to these models with the purpose of maximizing two objective functions (i.e., F1-scores and cost effectiveness). To further improve the prediction accuracy, we propose CPCC+ by combining CPCC with PCC proposed by Jiang, Tan, and Kim To evaluate the benefits of CPCC+ and CPCC, we perform experiments on six large software projects from different communities: Eclipse JDT, Jackrabbit, Linux kernel, Lucene, PostgreSQL, and Xorg. The experiment results show that CPCC+ can discover up to 245 more bugs than PCC+ (468 versus 223 for PostgreSQL) if developers inspect the top 20% lines of code that are predicted buggy. In addition, CPCC+ can achieve F1-scores of 0.60-0.75, which are statistically significantly higher than those of PCC+ on all of the six projects.

AB The aim of this paper is to develop an effective method for solving matrix game with payoffs of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (TrFNs). The method always assures that players' gain-floor and loss-ceiling have a common TrFN-type fuzzy value and hereby any matrix game with payoffs of TrFNs has a TrFN-type fuzzy value. The matrix game is first converted to a fuzzy linear programming problem, which is converted to three different optimization problems, which are then solved to get the optimum value of the game. The proposed method has an edge over other method as this focuses only on matrix games with payoff element as symmetric trapezoidal fuzzy number, which might not always be the case.

AB Multi-robot cellular manufacturing systems utilize several articulated industrial robots that cooperatively perform a large number of complex operations when assembling products. To enhance the system performance when designing layouts for such robotic cellular manufacturing systems, the positions of robots and other manufacturing system components must be appropriately determined by considering the sequence of tasks the robots conduct during the assembly process. This paper proposes a new multiobjective layout design optimization technique for robotic cellular manufacturing system layouts that can simultaneously determine the positions of manufacturing components and also task scheduling. First, in this paper, sequence-pair representation is used to specify layout design candidates that inherently avoid interference between assembly system components, and the use of dummy components is introduced to represent layout areas that provide necessary and appropriate spacing between manufacturing system components. In addition, task allocations for each robot are considered as discrete design variables. The design criteria for robot cellular manufacturing system layout designs are clarified and the layout design problem is formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem. To solve the optimization problem, a method based on a multiobjective genetic algorithm is proposed and numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB The application of on-grid hybrid power system (HPS) has been effective for harnessing renewable energy resources and ensuring environmental sustainability. A number of algebraic and mathematical modeling approaches have been introduced for the optimisation of on-grid HPS. While algebraic power pinch analysis (PoPA) tools have been developed to enable the selection of cost-effective energy storage technology, the available mathematical modeling approaches have yet to consider the economics and storage system selection in the design of an optimal on-grid HPS. This work presents a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) for the optimal design of an on-grid HPS with the minimum net present value (NPV) of the overall electricity production cost and the selection of the optimum energy storage technology. Two case studies are presented in this work. In the former, the differences between the developed MILP model and previous methods are highlighted, with sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of electricity tariff on the on-grid HPS. In the second case study, the developed MILP model was applied to an Eco-Industrial Park (EIP) case study with energy storage technology selection. Lead-acid battery system was found to be the optimal choice due to its low investment requirement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The study of the interactions between the economy (at national, global and local levels), the energy sector and the corresponding impacts on the environment inherently involves multiple axes of evaluation of distinct policies. Input-output (IO) analysis offers a consistent framework for developing multiobjective models for assessing the trade-offs associated with those policies. The analytical framework of IO analysis enables to model the interactions between the whole economy and the energy sector, thus identifying the energy required for the provision of goods and services in an economy and also quantifying the corresponding pollutant emissions. This paper is aimed at reviewing the different modelling approaches available in the scientific literature based on coupling IO analysis with multiobjective models, which can be particularly useful for policy makers to assess the trade-offs between the economy-energy-environment-social pillars of sustainable development, particularly relevant in the current sluggish economic context.

AB This paper presents a multiobjective optimization approach for synthesizing water distribution networks involving dualpurpose power plants. The proposed model accounts for environmental, economic, and social objectives by accounting for greenhouse gas emissions, jobs, and net profit. The model considers water and energy demands for domestic, agricultural, and industrial users. Energy is provided through several alternatives including fossil fuels (i.e., natural gas and oil), biofuels (i.e., biomass, biogas, biodiesel, and bioethanol), and solar energy. Water demands are satisfied by fresh water from dams, lakes, rivers, aquifers, and artificial storage tanks. The proposed model is applied to a case study from the Mexican State of Sonora. The results show the viability of the dual-purpose power -water plants, the merits of incorporating solar energy in the system, and the economic, environmental, and social benefits of applying the proposed approach. The optimal solution yields a total annual profit of $MM 1,545.9, it generates 1.37 x 10(7) ton CO2 equiv/y and 19 781 jobs.

A population-based multiobjective optimization design approach is used to design the new machine topology and compare it to a conventional symmetrical surface mounted PMSM. Results obtained demonstrate that improved performance is attainable with the asymmetrical design. Validation of the results is carried out by means of three-dimensional finite element analyses.

AB Decomposition-based algorithms have become increasingly popular for evolutionary multiobjective optimization. However, the effect of scalarizing methods used in these algorithms is still far from being well understood. This paper analyzes a family of frequently used scalarizing methods, the L-p methods, and shows that the p value is crucial to balance the selective pressure toward the Pareto optimal and the algorithm robustness to Pareto optimal front (PF) geometries. It demonstrates that an L-p method that can maximize the search ability of a decomposition-based algorithm exists and guarantees that, given some weight, any solution along the PF can be found. Moreover, a simple yet effective method called Pareto adaptive scalarizing (PaS) approximation is proposed to approximate the optimal p value. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of PaS, we incorporate PaS into a state-of-the-art decomposition-based algorithm, i.e., multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), and compare the resultant MOEA/D-PaS with some other MOEA/D variants on a set of problems with different PF geometries and up to seven conflicting objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that the PaS is effective.

AB Traditional multiobjective evolutionary algorithms face a great challenge when dealing with many objectives. This is due to a high proportion of nondominated solutions in the population and low selection pressure toward the Pareto front. In order to tackle this issue, a series of indicator-based algorithms have been proposed to guide the search process toward the Pareto front. However, a single indicator might be biased and lead the population to converge to a subregion of the Pareto front. In this paper, a multi-indicator-based algorithm is proposed for many-objective optimization problems. The proposed algorithm, namely stochastic ranking-based multi-indicator Algorithm (SRA), adopts the stochastic ranking technique to balance the search biases of different indicators. Empirical studies on a large number (39 in total) of problem instances from two well-defined benchmark sets with 5, 10, and 15 objectives demonstrate that SRA performs well in terms of inverted generational distance and hypervolume metrics when compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. Empirical studies also reveal that, in the case a problem requires the algorithm to have strong convergence ability, the performance of SRA can be further improved by incorporating a direction-based archive to store well-converged solutions and maintain diversity.

In this paper, we divide data-driven optimization problems into two categories, i.e., offline and online data-driven optimization, and discuss the main challenges involved therein. An evolutionary algorithm is then presented to optimize the design of a trauma system, which is a typical offline data-driven multiobjective optimization problem, where the objectives and constraints can be evaluated using incidents only. As each single function evaluation involves a large amount of patient data, we develop a multifidelity surrogate-management strategy to reduce the computation time of the evolutionary optimization. The main idea is to adaptively tune the approximation fidelity by clustering the original data into different numbers of clusters and a regression model is constructed to estimate the required minimum fidelity. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is able to save up to 90% of computation time without much sacrifice of the solution quality.

AB A minimum Manhattan distance (MMD) approach to multiple criteria decision making in multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) is proposed. The approach selects the final solution corresponding with a vector that has the MMD from a normalized ideal vector. This procedure is equivalent to the knee selection described by a divide and conquer approach that involves iterations of pairwise comparisons. Being able to systematically assign weighting coefficients to multiple criteria, the MMD approach is equivalent to a weighted-sum (WS) approach. Because of the equivalence, the MMD approach possesses rich geometric interpretations that are considered essential in the field of evolutionary computation. The MMD approach is elegant because all evaluations can be performed by efficient matrix calculations without iterations of comparisons. While the WS approach may encounter an indeterminate situation in which a few solutions yield almost the same WS, the MMD approach is able to determine the final solution discriminately. Since existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms aim for a posteriori decision making, i.e., determining the final solution after a set of Pareto optimal solutions is available, the proposed MMD approach can be combined with them to form a powerful solution method of solving MOPs. Furthermore, the approach enables scalable definitions of the knee and knee solutions.

AB This review paper presents an overview of simulation-based hydrodynamic design optimization of ship hull forms. A computational tool that is aimed to accomplishing early-stage simulation-based design in terms of hydrodynamic performance is discussed in detail. The main components of this computational tool consist of a hydrodynamic module, a hull surface modeling module, and an optimization module. The hydrodynamic module includes both design-oriented simple CFD tools and high-fidelity CFD tools. These integrated CFD tools are used for evaluating hydrodynamic performances at different design stages. The hull surface modeling module includes various techniques for ship hull surface representation and modification. This module is used to automatically produce hull forms or modify existing hull forms in terms of hydrodynamic performance and design constraints. The optimization module includes various optimization algorithms and surrogate models, which are used to determine optimal designs in terms of given hydrodynamic performance. As an illustration of the computational tool, a Series 60 hull is optimized for reduced drag using three different modification strategies to outline the specific procedure for conducting simulation-based hydrodynamic design of ship hull forms using the present tool. Numerical results show that the present tool is well suited for the hull form design optimization at early design stage because it can produce effective optimal designs within a short period of time.

AB Shading design to optimize daylighting is in many cases achieved through a designer's sense based on prior knowledge and experience. However, computer-assisted parametric techniques can be utilized for daylighting design in an easy and much more accurate way. If such tools are utilized in the early stages of a project, this can be more effective for sustainable design. This study compares the conventional approach, which depends on a designer's sense of judgment to create optimal indoor lighting conditions by adjusting louver shapes and window patterns, with the approach of making use of genetic algorithms. Ultimately, this study discusses the advantages and disadvantages of those two approaches. As a starting point, 30 designers were instructed to design a facade by manually adjusting several input parameters of shading. The parameters govern six kinds of louver and window types, with the ratio of analysis grid surface area achieving a daylight factor of 2%-5%. Secondly, input parameters were automatically created by using genetic algorithm optimization methods to find optimal fitness data. As a conclusion, conventional approaches result in a strong disposition toward designing certain shading types represented by linear relationships. Computer-assisted daylight simulation can help influence this, being effective when dealing with a large amount of data and non-linear relationships.

AB Nowadays, manufacturing enterprises face the challenge of just-in-time (JIT) production and energy saving. Therefore, study of JIT production and energy consumption is necessary and important in manufacturing sectors. Moreover, energy saving can be attained by the operational method and turn off/on idle machine method, which also increases the complexity of problem solving. Thus, most researchers still focus on small scale problems with one objective: a single machine environment. However, the scheduling problem is a multi-objective optimization problem in real applications. In this paper, a single machine scheduling model with controllable processing and sequence dependence setup times is developed for minimizing the total earliness/tardiness (E/T), cost, and energy consumption simultaneously. An effective multi-objective evolutionary algorithm called local multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (LMOEA) is presented to tackle this multi-objective scheduling problem. To accommodate the characteristic of the problem, a new solution representation is proposed, which can convert discrete combinational problems into continuous problems. Additionally, a multiple local search strategy with self-adaptive mechanism is introduced into the proposed algorithm to enhance the exploitation ability. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by instances with comparison to other multi-objective meta-heuristics such as Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2), Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization (OMOPSO), and Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition (MOEA/D). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LMOEA algorithm outperforms its counterparts for this kind of scheduling problems.

AB Coupling reactor has been identified as one of the most promising configurations for simultaneous production of methanol and hydrogen; as well stabilizing the atmospheric greenhouse gases level. In this work, methanol synthesis is carried out in exothermic side, which is a fluidized-bed reactor with in-situ water adsorption and supplies the necessary heat for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane in endothermic side. Simulation results show that selective water adsorption from methanol synthesis in Fluidized bed Sorption Enhanced Thermally Coupled Reactor (FSE-TCR) leads to a considerable intensification of methanol production compared to zero solid mass ratio condition. Subsequently, a multi-objective optimization of FSE-TCR is conducted using the NSGA-II algorithm, and Pareto optimal frontiers are obtained in two cases including the maximum methanol production rate and selectivity. The Shannon's Entropy, LINMAP, and TOPSIS methods as three decision making approaches are used to select the final solution of Pareto front. The optimization results enhance about 214.3 and 280.5 ton day(-1) methanol production rate and CO2 removal rate, respectively, based TOPSIS methods in comparison with the conventional methanol configuration. Furthermore, the optimization results represent 6.88 ton day(-1) enhancement in hydrogen production rate in comparison with the non-optimized configuration using the same catalyst loading and duty.

The GUI-based interface supports a variety of environmental management problems and can provide best practices in a timely manner. The toolkit is generic and applicable to any scientific field. It was applied on a renewable energy (RE) system's management. The developed model simulates the hydraulic characteristics of a small-scale hydropower (SHP) station. Harmony search algorithm (HSA) toolkit optimized the SHP's operation, without violating the ecological constraints related to environmental flow (EF) regimes. This was equal to maximizing the revenues from SHP's energy production in terms of a hypothetical fluctuating market. Apart from securing the provision of EF regimes, HSA toolkit's outcome provided management practices that increased the total economic gains. Supporting the economic viability of SHPs and their environmental friendliness is needed to strengthen their role in the RE mix.

AB Predicted water shortages assign water treatment a leading role in improving water resources management. One of the main challenges associated with the processes remains early stage design of techno-economically optimised purification. This work addresses the current gap by undertaking a whole-system approach of flowsheet synthesis for the production of water at desired purity at minimum overall cost. The optimisation problem was formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming model. Two case studies were presented which incorporated the most common commercial technologies and the major pollution indicators, such as chemical oxygen demand, dissolved organic carbon, total suspended solids and total dissolved solids. The results were analysed and compared to existing guidelines in order to examine the applicability of the proposed approach.

AB The paper describes a systematic framework that uses exergoeconomic theory integrated into 'building energy retrofit' (BER) design. An exergoeconomic module, based on the SPECO method, has been embedded into 'EXRETOpt', a recently developed retrofit-oriented exergy simulation tool based on EnergyPlus. Both active and passive technologies were analysed using two calibrated archetype non-domestic buildings as case studies (an office and a primary school). A novel cost-benefit indicator which accounts for building exergy destruction cost, retrofit annual capital cost, and project annual revenue is presented. This indicator is employed to account for best exergoeconomic performance technologies and to further develop deep BER packages. Compared to typical practice, exergoeconomics combined with cost-benefit provides a powerful tool for exploration and design improvement of building energy systems. In both cases, final product cost for heating and cooling processes were substantially reduced. In addition, the office case presented improvements in energy use by 67%, CO2 emissions by 53%, thermal comfort by 22%, exergy destructions by 42%, and the overall building exergy efficiency was improved from 14.8% to 20.0%.

AB The objective of this paper is to combine sensitivity analysis and simulation-based optimisation in order to optimise the thermal and energy performance of residential buildings in the Argentine Littoral region. An actual house was selected as case study. This is a typical, local, single-family house having some rooms conditioned only by natural ventilation, and other rooms with natural ventilation supplemented by mechanical air-conditioning (hybrid ventilation). Hence, the total degree-hours at the naturally ventilated living room and the total energy consumption by air-conditioning at the bedrooms were chosen as objective functions to be minimised. The global objective function characterising the thermal and energy performance of the house was defined as the weighted sum of these objective functions. This objective function was computed using the EnergyPlus building performance simulation programme. Then, we performed a sensitivity analysis using the Morris screening method to rank the influence of the design variables on the objective function. This showed that the type of external walls, the windows infiltration rate and the solar azimuth were the most influential design variables on the given objective function for the considered house, and also that the azimuth either had a highly nonlinear effect on the objective function or was highly correlated to the others variables, deserving in any case a finer discretisation.
   Finally, we solved an optimisation problem using genetic algorithms in order to find the optimal set of design variables for the considered house. The results highlighted the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed methodology to redesign a typical house in the Argentine Littoral region, improving hugely its thermal and energy performance.

AB Trichloroethylene (TCE) and other solvents are found as groundwater contaminants in industrial complexes. Pump-andtreat (PAT) systems are commonly selected for remediation, but have the disadvantages of long operation time and high cost. To reduce the remediation time and cost of PAT systems, a cost-effective optimal design was obtained with a simulation-optimization model. MODFLOW and MT3DMS were used for simulating groundwater flow and contaminant transport. A genetic algorithm was used for optimization, and a parallel computing technique was used for faster optimization. Cost-effective optimal design was achieved using two objective functions, which calculated the total remediation cost by means of installation, operational, and maintenance costs. Based on the restrictions in the study area, two remediation scenarios were examined. Scenario 1 involved the removal of TCE, and Scenario 2 involved the containment of TCE within the compliance line. The total remediation costs of scenario 2 were 77.490.4% of scenario 1. The remediation time decreased from 9.87 years in scenario 1 to 8.13 years in scenario 2. Sensitivity analysis determined the effects of installation, operational, and maintenance costs on the total remediation cost, showing that optimal total cost and remediation time were most affected by operational cost. A parallel computing technique using 40 networked slave processes increased optimization speed by 16.9 times. However, the efficiency of the parallel computing technique decreased as networking time increased.

AB This paper proposes a new multiobjective optimization approach to designing a fuzzy logic system (FLS) using process data and applies it to the wall-following control of a mobile robot. The objectives considered include both the interpretability and control performance of the FLS. It is assumed that no off-line training data are available in advance, and the rule base is initially empty. All rules are generated through an online clustering and fuzzy set merging (OCFM) algorithm using data generated online during the FLS evaluation process. The OCFM builds a reference rule base that flexibly partitions the input space with distinguishable fuzzy sets (FSs). Based on the reference rule base, a new multiobjective front-guided continuous ant-colony optimization ( MO-FCACO) algorithm is proposed to optimize the FLS structure and parameters. In addition to the objective functions defined to evaluate the FLS control performance, a transparency-oriented objective function is defined with constraints imposed on the FS parameters to obtain an interpretable FLS with transparent FSs. The MO-FCACO solves the constrained multiobjective optimization problem by optimizing all of the free parameters in an FLS through ant-path selection, sampling operation, and front-guided optimization processes. The multiobjective FLS design approach is applied to control the orientation and moving speed of a mobile robot in performing the wall-following task. Optimization performance of the MO-FCACO is verified through comparisons with various multiobjective population-based optimization algorithms. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the designed FLSs in controlling a real robot.

AB The nearest neighbor (NN) classifier suffers from high time complexity when classifying a test instance since the need of searching the whole training set. Prototype generation is a widely used approach to reduce the classification time, which generates a small set of prototypes to classify a test instance instead of using the whole training set. In this paper, particle swarm optimization is applied to prototype generation and two novel methods for improving the classification performance are presented: 1) a fitness function named error rank and 2) the multiobjective (MO) optimization strategy. Error rank is proposed to enhance the generation ability of the NN classifier, which takes the ranks of misclassified instances into consideration when designing the fitness function. The MO optimization strategy pursues the performance on multiple subsets of data simultaneously, in order to keep the classifier from overfitting the training set. Experimental results over 31 UCI data sets and 59 additional data sets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms nearly 30 existing prototype generation algorithms.

AB This paper presents a cooperative differential evolution (DE) with multiple populations for multiobjective optimization. The proposed algorithm has M single-objective optimization subpopulations and an archive population for an M-objective optimization problem. An adaptive DE is applied to each subpopulation to optimize the corresponding objective of the multiobjective optimization problem (MOP). The archive population is also optimized by an adaptive DE. The archive population is used not only to maintain all nondominated solutions found so far but also to guide each subpopulation to search along the whole Pareto front. These (M + 1) populations cooperate to optimize all objectives of the MOP by using adaptive DEs. Simulation results on benchmark problems with two, three, and many objectives show that the proposed algorithm is better than some state-of-the-art multiobjective DE algorithms and other popular multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. The online search behavior and parameter sensitivity of the proposed algorithm are also investigated.

AB Evolutionary algorithms are effective in solving static multiobjective optimization problems resulting in the emergence of a number of state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). Nevertheless, the interest in applying them to solve dynamic multiobjective optimization problems has only been tepid. Benchmark problems, appropriate performance metrics, as well as efficient algorithms are required to further the research in this field. One or more objectives may change with time in dynamic optimization problems. The optimization algorithm must be able to track the moving optima efficiently. A prediction model can learn the patterns from past experience and predict future changes. In this paper, a new dynamic MOEA using Kalman filter (KF) predictions in decision space is proposed to solve the aforementioned problems. The predictions help to guide the search toward the changed optima, thereby accelerating convergence. A scoring scheme is devised to hybridize the KF prediction with a random reinitialization method. Experimental results and performance comparisons with other state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of significantly improving the dynamic optimization performance.

AB When solving constrained optimization problems by evolutionary algorithms, an important issue is how to balance constraints and objective function. This paper presents a new method to address the above issue. In our method, after generating an offspring for each parent in the population by making use of differential evolution (DE), the well-known feasibility rule is used to compare the offspring and its parent. Since the feasibility rule prefers constraints to objective function, the objective function information has been exploited as follows: if the offspring cannot survive into the next generation and if the objective function value of the offspring is better than that of the parent, then the offspring is stored into a predefined archive. Subsequently, the individuals in the archive are used to replace some individuals in the population according to a replacement mechanism. Moreover, a mutation strategy is proposed to help the population jump out of a local optimum in the infeasible region. Note that, in the replacement mechanism and the mutation strategy, the comparison of individuals is based on objective function. In addition, the information of objective function has also been utilized to generate offspring in DE. By the above processes, this paper achieves an effective balance between constraints and objective function in constrained evolutionary optimization. The performance of our method has been tested on two sets of benchmark test functions, namely, 24 test functions at IEEE CEC2006 and 18 test functions with 10-D and 30-D at IEEE CEC2010. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method shows better or at least competitive performance against other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the advantage of our method increases with the increase of the number of decision variables.

AB Premature convergence is one of the best-known drawbacks that affects the performance of evolutionary algorithms. An alternative for dealing with this problem is to explicitly try to maintain proper diversity. In this paper, a new replacement strategy that preserves useful diversity is presented. The novelty of our method is that it combines the idea of transforming a single-objective problem into a multiobjective one, by considering diversity as an explicit objective, with the idea of adapting the balance induced between exploration and exploitation to the various optimization stages. Specifically, in the initial phases, larger amounts of diversity are accepted. The diversity measure considered in this paper is based on calculating distances to the closest surviving individual. Analyses with a multimodal function better justify the design decisions and provide greater insight into the working operation of the proposal. Computational results with a packing problem that was proposed in a popular contest illustrate the usefulness of the proposal. The new method significantly improves on the best results known to date for this problem and compares favorably against a large number of state-of-the-art schemes.

AB Research on multiobjective optimization problems becomes one of the hottest topics of intelligent computation. In order to improve the search efficiency of an evolutionary algorithm and maintain the diversity of solutions, in this paper, the learning automata (LA) is first used for quantization orthogonal crossover (QOX), and a new fitness function based on decomposition is proposed to achieve these two purposes. Based on these, an orthogonal evolutionary algorithm with LA for complex multiobjective optimization problems with continuous variables is proposed. The experimental results show that in continuous states, the proposed algorithm is able to achieve accurate Pareto-optimal sets and wide Pareto-optimal fronts efficiently. Moreover, the comparison with the several existing well-known algorithms: nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II, decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, decompositionbased multiobjective evolutionary algorithm with an ensemble of neighborhood sizes, multiobjective optimization by LA, and multiobjective immune algorithm with nondominated neighbor-based selection, on 15 multiobjective benchmark problems, shows that the proposed algorithm is able to find more accurate and evenly distributed Pareto-optimal fronts than the compared ones.

AB Electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing to decode motor imagery (MI) involves high-dimensional features, which increases the computational complexity. To reduce this computational burden due to the large number of channels, an iterative multiobjective optimization for channel selection (IMOCS) is proposed in this paper. For a given MI classification task, the proposed method initializes a reference candidate solution and subsequently finds a set of the most relevant channels in an iterative manner by exploiting both the anatomical and functional relevance of EEG channels. The proposed approach is evaluated on the Wadsworth dataset for the right fist versus left fist MI tasks, while considering the cross-validation accuracy as the performance evaluation criteria. Furthermore, 12 other dimension reduction and channel selection algorithms are used for benchmarking. The proposed approach (IMOCS) achieved an average classification accuracy of about 80% when evaluated using 35 best-performing subjects. One-way analysis of variance revealed the statistical significance of the proposed approach with at least 7% improvement over other benchmarking algorithms. Furthermore, a cross-subject generalization of channel selection on untrained subjects shows that the subject-independent channels perform as good as using all channels achieving an average classification accuracy of 61%. These results are promising for the online brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm that requires low computational complexity and also for reducing the preparation time while conducting multiple session BCI experiments for a larger pool of subjects.

AB The drag and heat reduction problem of hypersonic vehicles has always attracted the attention worldwide, and the experimental test approach is the basis of theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. In the current study, research progress of experimental investigations on drag and heat reduction are summarized by several kinds of mechanism, namely the forward-facing cavity, the opposing jet, the aerospike, the energy deposition and their combinational configurations, and the combinational configurations include the combinational opposing jet and forward-facing cavity concept and the combinational opposing jet and aerospike concept. The geometric models and flow conditions are emphasized, especially for the basic principle for the drag and heat flux reduction of each device. The measurement results of aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic are compared and analyzed as well, which can be a reference for assessing the accuracy of numerical results. (C) 2016 IAA.

AB Search-based software engineering (SBSE) solutions are still not scalable enough to handle high-dimensional objectives space. The majority of existing work treats software engineering problems from a single or bi-objective point of view, where the main goal is to maximize or minimize one or two objectives. However, most software engineering problems are naturally complex in which many conflicting objectives need to be optimized. Software refactoring is one of these problems involving finding a compromise between several quality attributes to improve the quality of the system while preserving the behavior. To this end, we propose a novel representation of the refactoring problem as a many-objective one where every quality attribute to improve is considered as an independent objective to be optimized. In our approach based on the recent NSGA-III algorithm, the refactoring solutions are evaluated using a set of 8 distinct objectives. We evaluated this approach on one industrial project and seven open source systems. We compared our findings to: several other many-objective techniques (IBEA, MOEA/D, GrEA, and DBEA-Eps), an existing multi-objective approach a mono-objective technique and an existing refactoring technique not based on heuristic search. Statistical analysis of our experiments over 31 runs shows the efficiency of our approach.

AB Hot charging of continuous cast steel billets is usually considered an effective method for recovering heat. However, for certain grades of steel, the hot charging process may affect the steel surface quality. To overcome this issue, the billet is commonly cooled down before rolling, resulting in substantial heat loss. Thus, the recovery of useful waste heat without affecting steel quality is an important research topic. In this study, the design of a flash power system driven by the process heat of continuous casting grade steel billet is proposed. The influences of shunted water temperature and flash pressure on exergy recovery rate are studied via the thermodynamic methods. Moreover, a case study based on actual data is analyzed to verify the thermodynamic results and the energy recovery of the proposed system. The results indicate that the system exergy recovery rate increases with increasing shunted water temperature. Keeping the shunted temperature unchanged the exergy recovery rate firstly increases and later decreases with increasing flash pressure. At a fixed shunt temperature, an optimum flash pressure exists. At the maximum exergy recovery rate the net output power of the studied plant is 6361 kW, a value that greatly reduces the need for purchased electricity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) consisting of photovoltaic (PV), wind and forest wood biomass power for cogeneration, and applies a multi-objective optimization methodology to study the trade-offs between life-cycle cost and environmental impact (EI) of such a system. The optimization is achieved by applying an operation strategy that maximizes the efficiency of the biomass power subsystem coupled with an optimization model based on the use of genetic algorithm (GA) to obtain the optimal system sizing. The system is designed to supply the electricity demand of a rural township and the thermal demand - both heating and sanitary hot water (SHW) - of a neighborhood in a district heating (DH) scheme. Indigenously available renewable energy sources (RES) are used, taking special care in the case of biomass to not exceed the self-growth rate of local tree species. Results show that by taldng advantage of the thermal energy produced, the payback time of the investment required to install the system is significantly reduced, being profitable after 9 years. Furthermore, it is also observed that layouts with low costs have greater EI and vice versa. However, it is shown that moderate cost increases have great returns on EI reduction.

AB Multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithms are among the best optimizers for solving problems in control systems, engineering and industrial planning. The performance of these algorithms degrades severely due to the loss of selection pressure exerted by the Pareto dominance relation which will cause the algorithm to act randomly. Various recent methods tried to provide more selection pressure but this would cause the population to converge to a specific region which is not desirable. Diversity reduction in high dimensional problems which decreases the capabilities of these approaches is a decisive factor in the overall performance of these algorithms. The novelty of this paper is to propose a new diversity measure and a diversity control mechanism which can be used in combination to remedy the mentioned problem. This measure is based on shortest Hamiltonian path for capturing an order of the population in any dimension. In order to control the diversity of population, we designed an adaptive framework which adjusts the selection operator according to diversity variation in the population using different diversity measures as well as our proposed one. This study incorporates the proposed framework in MOEA/D, an efficient widely used evolutionary algorithm. The obtained results validate the motivation on the basis of diversity and performance measures in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm/method in handling many-objective problems. Moreover, an extensive comparison with several diversity measure algorithms reveals the competitiveness of our proposed measure.

We develop an analytical model to calculate the torque and validate our results using finite element analysis considering a non-linear relationship between magnetic field and magnetic flux. Using genetic algorithm, we optimize the system's dimensions to generate maximum torque. The optimized geometry shows an improvement in output torque compared to existing systems. Moreover, our design directs higher flux onto the MR fluid and subsequently generates greater shear frictions. This design can be used in applications such as rehabilitation devices.

AB Bio-inspired engineering design has drawn increased attention in recent years for the excellent structural and mechanical properties of the biological systems. In this study, the horsetail-bionic thin-walled structures (HBTSs) were investigated for their crashworthiness under axial dynamic loading. Six HBTSs with different cross section configurations (i.e., number of cells) were evaluated using nonlinear finite element (FE) simulations. To obtain the optimal design of the HBTSs, an ensemble metamodel-based multi-objective optimization method was employed to maximize the specific energy absorption while minimizing maximum impact force of the HBTSs. Using the ensemble metamodeling, FE simulations and the NSGA-II algorithm, the Pareto optimum designs of all six HBTSs were obtained and the HBTS with 16 cells were found to have the best crashworthiness. An optimum design of the HBTS with 16 cells was verified using FE simulation and found to have good agreement with simulation results.

AB A new organic Rankine cycle (ORC) architecture: partial evaporating organic Rankine cycle (PEORC) with the zeotropic mixture R245fa/R227ea as working fluid is presented in this paper. The thermodynamic first law analysis as well as the second law analysis were applied to evaluate the system performance. A techno-thermodynamic evaluation on heat exchangers and the expander was also performed in this research. The mass fraction of R227ea (corresponding to zeotropic mixture) and the expander inlet vapor quality (corresponding to PEORC) are chosen as the independent variables. The results showed that both the new cycle architecture: PEORC and zeotropic mixture working fluid can improve the thermodynamic performance and more importantly they can be combined together to further enhance the system. The optimized PEORC with R245fa/R227ea is able to generate about 24.7% more power than the traditional subcritical organic Rankine cycle (SCORC) with R227ea as working fluid. However, the heat exchanger economy may become worse, which should be considered. The results also revealed that the mixture working fluid mainly reduces the exergy loss in the condenser because of the temperature glide characteristic while the PEORC mainly reduces the exergy loss in the evaporator by improving the temperature matching between heat source and working fluid.

AB Total dissolved solids (TDS) may enter reservoirs at high concentrations during flooding events. The release of TDS from reservoirs depends on water quality stratification within them. This paper presents an approach for the optimal operation of a reservoir with two objectives: (1) the minimization of TDS in reservoir releases, and (2) the minimization of the temperature difference between inflow to the reservoir and released water from the reservoir. The Karaj reservoir in Iran is operated to optimize these two objectives. The reservoir has two water outlets with an elevation difference equal to 40 m. Water quality and 2D hydrodynamic modeling is carried out with the model CE-QUAL-W2, which is coupled with the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) to produce a simulation-optimization method. The simulation-optimization method is applied to the Karaj reservoir operation under four scenarios (seasons). The paper's results indicate enhanced reservoir operation with two-outlet releases compared with one-outlet releases. Specifically, the TDS in reservoir releases and the temperature difference between inflow into and released water from the reservoir achieved with two-outlet operation are 11.81 and 4.02% lower than those achieved with single-outlet operation, respectively.

AB The optimization of a multiresponse manufacturing process is not a trivial task. Many authors have tried to overcome the particular difficulties observed in this knowledge area exploring the powerful mechanisms present in a great deal of techniques like design of experiments, response surface methodology (RSM), principal component analysis (PCA) and mathematical programming. In this sense, this paper presents an alternative hybrid approach, combining RSM and data envelopment analysis (DEA), a popular linear programming technique useful to compare efficiency of decision making units. The basic idea is to optimize a set of multiple correlated responses of a well-defined manufacturing process using DEA as an algorithm for generated the singular objective function. This alternative proposal is compared to multivariate response surface methodology, a stochastic approach based on the PCA, a multivariate statistical technique usually employed with Taguchi multiresponse designs. Since a great number of manufacturing processes present sets of multiple correlated responses, a case study based in a five quality characteristics of a pulsed GMAW welding process is here presented to illustrate the comparative performance of two proposals. The results indicate close responses for both methods. In spite of this, DEA was considered better because its results are larger in parameters that we wanted maximize and are smaller in parameters we wanted minimize. All established constraints were not violated in both cases of DEA.

AB Analytical optimal hedging rules are derived for two-objective reservoir operation based on the characteristics of economic and multilevel environmental water demands. This approach is employed to balance current and future economic and environmental water demands using a two-period model. According to the marginal values of utilities, the derived three-step hedging rule curves (THRCs) consist of three steps and six stages. The Huaihe River basin of China is taken as an example to regress the THRCs from a two-objective optimization model. Results show that the derived THRCs can be regressed from the optimal release decision, thereby confirming the derivations and theoretical analysis. The shapes of the THRCs are sensitive to the weight parameters of the objectives and capture the core concern of multiobjective reservoir operation. The THRCs tend to widen and flatten the stages with increasing storage capacity, which implies more water storage and more consideration for future demands.

AB This study aims to find the best cross-sectional shapes of thin-walled columns enduring an oblique impact loading for crashworthiness. For approximating to the shape, spline polynomials are used with four key-points benefiting from the double symmetry of the cross section. Crashworthiness is defined by using a multi-objective function. By using Latin hypercubes design of experiment methodology, the design space is sampled. Based on the finite elements analyses, the objective functions are approximated by adopting radial basis function network. The corresponding Pareto front is found by Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II. It is found that plus-sign-like cross-sections have better performance than benchmarks for all objectives.

AB Circular tube filled with cellular materials becomes a fairly attractive structural option in energy absorbing devices, such as crash box and front rail in vehicle. This paper introduces a novel configuration, namely double functionally graded (DFG) structure, which comprises of a functionally graded honeycomb filler in a functionally graded thickness (FGT) tube. Based on the validated finite element (FE) models, a comparative study on the DFG tube, single functionally graded (SFG) tube, and traditional uniform honeycomb filled uniform thickness (H-UT) tube were carried out to explore the crashing behaviors of different structures under multiple load cases. It is found that as crushing displacement increases, DFG structure exhibits superior capacity of energy absorption over other configurations and this trend is positively related to the impact angles. In addition, the comparisons of deformation modes and critical crushing angles clearly indicate that the DFG structure is of better and more stable crashing characteristics, being a crashworthy structure. Following the configurational comparison, further parametric studies on the DFG structures were conducted to explore the effects of tubal thickness range and honeycomb thickness range on the crashworthiness. It is found that the tube thickness range is more important to crashworthiness, which provides a basis for structural optimization.

AB Growing energy demand has increased the need to manage conflicts between energy production and the environment. As an example, shale-gas extraction requires substantial surface infrastructure, which fragments habitats, erodes soils, degrades freshwater systems, and displaces rare species. Strategic planning of shale-gas infrastructure can reduce trade-offs between economic and environmental objectives, but the specific nature of these trade-offs is not known. We estimated the cost of avoiding impacts from land-use change on forests, wetlands, rare species, and streams from shale-energy development within leaseholds. We created software for optimally siting shale-gas surface infrastructure to minimize its environmental impacts at reasonable construction cost. We visually assessed sites before infrastructure optimization to test whether such inspection could be used to predict whether impacts could be avoided at the site. On average, up to 38% of aggregate environmental impacts of infrastructure could be avoided for 20% greater development costs by spatially optimizing infrastructure. However, we found trade-offs between environmental impacts and costs among sites. In visual inspections, we often distinguished between sites that could be developed to avoid impacts at relatively low cost (29%) and those that could not (20%). Reductions in a metric of aggregate environmental impact could be largely attributed to potential displacement of rare species, sedimentation, and forest fragmentation. Planners and regulators can estimate and use heterogeneous trade-offs among development sites to create industry-wide improvements in environmental performance and do so at reasonable costs by, for example, leveraging low-cost avoidance of impacts at some sites to offset others. This could require substantial effort, but the results and software we provide can facilitate the process.

AB The selection of optimal thresholds is still a challenging task for researchers in case of multilevel thresholding. Many swarm and evolutionary computation techniques have been applied for obtaining optimal values of thresholds. The performance of all these computation techniques is highly dependent on proper selection of algorithm-specific parameters. In this work, a new hybrid optimization technique, membrane computing inspired teacher-learner-based-optimization (MCTLBO), is proposed which is based on the structure of membrane computing (MC) and teacher-learner-based-optimization (TLBO) algorithm. To prove the efficacy of proposed algorithm, it is applied to solve multilevel thresholding problem in which the Kapur's entropy criterion is considered as figure-of-merit. In this experiment, four benchmark test images are considered for multilevel thresholding. The optimal values of thresholds are obtained using TLBO, MC and particle swarm optimization (PSO) in addition to proposed algorithm to accomplish the comparative study. To support the superiority of proposed algorithm over others, various quantitative and qualitative results are presented in addition to statistical analysis.

AB The evolution of international regulation leads to new capital requirements imposed on globally active companies. Financial services firms allocate capital to business lines in order to withstand the materializing credit losses and to measure the performance of various business lines. In this study, we introduce a methodology for optimal credit capital allocation based on operations research approach. In particular, we focus on the efficient allocation of capital to business lines characterized by credit risk losses and cost of capital. We compare different allocation methods and provide a rationale behind using the OR approach. Finally, we formulate a multiobjective optimization model to capital allocation problem and apply it to a real-world case of two financial conglomerates.

AB Thin-walled aluminum alloy (Al alloy) structure, carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) tube, aluminum foam (Al foam) and polyurethane foam (PU foam) all can be used as good energy absorbers in automobile, aviation and other industries for their light weight and high energy absorption capacity. In order to clarify the advantages of the design modes, this article studies the crushing behaviors of circular, hexagonal and square CFRP and Al alloy tapered tube and their foam-filled structures subjected to quasi-static axial compression, analyzes and compares the collapse modes and force-displacement curves of these investigated structures as well as calculates the energy absorption (EA) and the specific energy absorption (SEA) of these investigated structures. Experimental results show that the CFRP tapered tubes have higher SEA than that of the Al-alloy tapered tubes and the circular CFRP tubes filled with PU foam have better energy absorption capacity than that of the square and hexagonal structures. In addition, the SEA of the CFRP tube filled with PU foam is 30% higher than that of the Al alloy tube filled with Al foam. Therefore this article leads to a conclusion that PU foam-filled CFRP tapered tube is a potential structure for energy absorber and light weight design. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article investigates the computational efficiency of constraint handling in multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithms for water distribution systems. The methodology investigated here encourages the co-existence and simultaneous development including crossbreeding of subpopulations of cost-effective feasible and infeasible solutions based on Pareto dominance. This yields a boundary search approach that also promotes diversity in the gene pool throughout the progress of the optimization by exploiting the full spectrum of non-dominated infeasible solutions. The relative effectiveness of small and moderate population sizes with respect to the number of decision variables is investigated also. The results reveal the optimization algorithm to be efficient, stable and robust. It found optimal and near-optimal solutions reliably and efficiently. The real-world system based optimization problem involved multiple variable head supply nodes, 29 fire-fighting flows, extended period simulation and multiple demand categories including water loss. The least cost solutions found satisfied the flow and pressure requirernents consistently. The best solutions achieved indicative savings of 48.1% and 48.2% based on the cost of the pipes in the existing network, for populations of 200 and 1000, respectively. The population of 1000 achieved slightly better results overall. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article under the CC BY license.

AB Classifying the pixels of satellite images into homogeneous regions is a very challenging task as different regions have different types of land covers. Some land covers contain more regions, while some contain relatively smaller regions (e.g., bridges, roads). In satellite image segmentation, no prior information is available about the number of clusters. Here, in this paper, we have solved this problem using the concepts of semi-supervised clustering which utilizes the property of unsupervised and supervised classification. Three cluster validity indices are utilized, which are simultaneously optimized using AMOSA, a modern multiobjective optimization technique based on the concepts of simulated annealing. The first two cluster validity indices, symmetry distance based Sym-index, and Euclidean distance based I-index, are based on unsupervised properties. The last one is a supervised information based cluster validity index, Minkowski index. For supervised information, initially fuzzy C-mean clustering technique is used. Thereafter, based on the highest membership values of the data points to their respective clusters, randomly 10 % data points with their class labels are chosen. The effectiveness of this proposed semi-supervised clustering technique is demonstrated on three satellite image data sets of different cities of India. Results are also compared with existing clustering techniques.

ID EVOLUTIONARY MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; TEST PROBLEM TOOLKIT
AB In recent years, many-objective optimization problems (i.e. more than three objectives) have attracted the interests of many researchers. The main difficulties of many-objective optimization problems lie in high computational cost, stagnation in search process, etc. It is almost impossible to design an algorithm effective for all problems. However, for some problems, especially for problems with redundant objectives, it is possible to design effective algorithms by removing the redundant objectives and keeping the non-redundant objectives so that the original problem becomes the one with much fewer objectives. To do so, first, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm-based decomposition is adopted to generate a smaller number of representative non-dominated solutions widely distributed on the Pareto front. Then the conflicting objective pairs are identified through these non-dominated solutions, and the redundant objectives are determined by these pairs and then removed. Based on these, a fast non-redundant objectives generation algorithm is proposed in this paper. Finally, the experiments are conducted on a set of benchmark test problems and the results indicate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

AB Estimation of parameters of chaotic systems is a subject of substantial and well-developed research issue in nonlinear science. From the viewpoint of optimization, parameter estimation can be formulated as a multi-modal constrained optimization problem with multiple decision variables. This investigation makes a systematic examination of the feasibility of applying a newly proposed population-based optimization method labeled here as teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) to identify the unknown parameters for a class of chaotic system. The preliminary test demonstrates that despite its global fast coarse search capability, teaching-learning-based optimization often risks getting prematurely stuck in local optima. To enhance its fine (local) searching performance of TLBO, Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm-based local improvement is incorporated into TLBO so as to continually search for the global optima through the reflection, expansion, contraction, and shrink operators. Working with the well-established Lorenz system, we assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed improved TLBO strategy. The empirical results indicate the success of the proposed hybrid approach in which the global exploration and the local exploitation are well balanced, providing the best solutions for all instances used over other state-of-the-art metaheuristics for chaotic identification in literature, including particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm, and quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm.

AB In this paper, a Gas Turbine + Multi Effect Desalination + Reverse Osmosis (GT + MED + RO) system is designed with respect to Siemens gas turbines, to provide water and electricity for Bashagerd County, located in the south of Iran (in the outskirts of Persian Gulf). There is 79.2 x 10(6) (kWh/year) and 103043 (m(3)/day) of electricity and water demand, respectively. Siemens GT model 400 (SGT400) is selected to provide electricity in the place. It is seen in MED system that there is a major difference between desalinated and required water. But, as we have high rates of flow in rejected water from MED condenser to the gulf, an RO system is used in rejected outflow of the MED system. By doing so, more fresh water is derived from the whole system. In this design, the recovery of RO system is 42 %, and final price 2.3 $ per cubic meter. By using GT + MED + RO hybrid system, not only the required electricity, but also enough fresh water can be produced for this County. The hybrid system had some added costs. And the final price is reduced from 2.8 to 2.3 $/m(3) by using the excess electricity to run the RO pump. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper coordinates the reconfiguration of distribution systems with the expansion problem while the potential of demand response (DR) programs and distributed generation (DG) units are modeled in the active distribution expansion planning. The concept of system of systems (SoS) is proposed to model the expansion of DGs that are owned by private investors. SoS is an efficient system consisting of some autonomous and heterogeneous systems with distinct objective functions. According to the concept of SoS, a decision-making paradigm is developed to determine the location, size, and time of DG investment made by a commercial agent, as well as the price of generated power. From the distribution company (DISCO) viewpoint, the proposed model is a multi-objective (MO) optimization problem. The first objective function is the net present value of the total investment and operation costs related to the network. The second objective function is a reliability index, i.e. the expected energy not-supplied (EENS). The uncertainty of load growth in future years is handled by using a scenario-based approach. The introduced problem is solved by using multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm empowered with an innovative three-layer procedure that is provided to better manage the space of the decision variables. The first layer is based on PSO particles while the second and third layers are based on a sensitivity analysis. Finally, a standard 33-bus distribution system is utilized to obtain the simulation results that show the performance and advantages of the proposed method. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB A multiobjective algorithm dedicated to simultaneously plan power distribution network and facility location, with focus on substation and distributed generation placement, is proposed in this work. This tool can perform the following operations: to plan the network topology, to assign the conductor capacities and types, to locate new generation units, and to analyse the robustness of the final network in order to help on decision making. In the design procedure, the minimization of both the monetary cost and the fault cost of the network for the "most likely" peak-load scenario are considered, for a future time horizon. The optimization of those different objective functions is performed in a multiobjective setting, leading to the determination of a Pareto-optimal solution set that describes the trade-offs involved in designer choices. The optimization algorithm is composed by a multiobjective genetic algorithm, deterministic local search operators, a procedure to locate new generation units, and a Monte Carlo simulator for evaluating system robustness. Uncertainties are considered in the load growth, energy price, and power supplied by the distributed generation units. The proposed tool allows scenario analyzes that go far beyond the simple cost per kilowatt or the availability rate figures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An analytical multiobjective maintenance planning model that maximizes reliability while minimizing cost and human error is proposed. In order to incorporate human error, the model minimizes the maximum human error over the planning horizon. Human Error Assessment and Reduction Technique (HEART) is used to quantify the human error. Maintenance activities include adjustment and replacement activities, in which each of them consumes a certain amount of human resource, spare parts, and budget and brings about a specified level of reliability and human error. Economic dependence is also considered, in which grouping maintenance activities reduces total cost. However, this may increase human error probability due to operator fatigue or time pressure. The main purpose is to investigate the relationship between human factors and maintenance activities to find the preferred maintenance plan. A multiple production line is considered as a case study. A sensitivity analysis is performed, and the effects of grouping and human factors on the preferred maintenance plan are discussed. It is shown how human proficiency may affect reliability and cost.

AB Integration, test and validation results, in a real-time environment, of a novel concept for spacecraft control are presented in this paper. The proposed method commands simultaneously a group of actuators optimizing a given set of objective functions based on a multiobjective optimization technique. Since close proximity maneuvers play an important role in orbital servicing missions, the entire GNC system has been integrated and tested at a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) rendezvous and docking simulator known as European Proximity Operations Simulator (EPOS). During the test campaign at EPOS facility, a visual camera has been used to provide the necessary measurements for calculating the relative position with respect to the target satellite during closed-loop simulations. In addition, two different configurations of spacecraft control have been considered in this paper: a thruster reaction control system and a mixed actuators mode which includes thrusters, reaction wheels, and magnetic torqrods. At EPOS, results of HIL closed-loop tests have demonstrated that a safe and stable rendezvous approach can be achieved with the proposed GNC loop.

AB When the indoor environment is designed by genetic algorithm (GA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the artificial neural network (ANN) plays a role of surrogate model of CFD to reduce the computational cost. To improve the performance of ANN, a self-updating logarithm normalized method was proposed to enhance the local prediction of ANN in the inverse design based on GA and ANN. An MD-82 aircraft cabin was used to test the performance of the proposed method, and different environmental parameters were chosen to be the objectives of the cabin environment. The success rate (SR) was used to evaluate the local prediction ability of ANN. Instead of linear normalized ANN, SR was found to be increased by 10.5% with the logarithm normalized ANN and the computational cost was reduced by 23.2% for the same quality of solution.

AB Optimization methods have shown to be a very important approach for control engineers. They emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert to tune the control gains for a process or system with the formulation and solution of a mathematical optimization problem. In such formulation, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been widely used to obtain the control gains. Nevertheless a bad selection of the control gains through the optimization process can result in instability of the closed-loop control system such that the convergence and diversity in the EAs can be compromised. In this paper the PID control tuning for a planar parallel robot with a five-bar mechanism to follow a highly nonlinear trajectory is stated as an off-line nonlinear dynamic optimization problem (OLNLDOP). In order to promote individuals with a stable behavior in the closed-loop control system, a dynamic constraint and a method to handle such constraint is proposed into the OLNLDOP and into eight different variants of the differential evolution algorithm, respectively. Comparative analysis shows that the proposal finds suitable solutions for the OLNLDOP with a better convergence time. Laboratory testing with the optimum PID control gains on a real prototype validates the tuning optimization method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Clustering learning and classification learning are two major tasks in pattern recognition. The traditional hybrid clustering and classification algorithms handle them in a sequential way rather than a simultaneous way.. Fortunately, multiobjective optimization provides a way to solve this problem. In this paper, an algorithm that learns simultaneous clustering and classification adaptively via multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is proposed. The main idea of this paper is to optimize two objective functions which represent fuzzy cluster connectedness and classification error rate to achieve the goal of simultaneous learning. Firstly, we adopt a graph based representation scheme to encode so that it can generate a set of solutions with different number of clusters in a single run. Then the relationship between clustering and classification is built via the Bayesian theory during the optimization process. The quality of clustering and classification is measured by the objective functions and the feedback drawn from both aspects is used to guide the mutation. At last, a set of nondominated solutions are generated, from which the final Pareto optimal solution is selected by using Adjusted Rand Index. The results on synthetic datasets and real-life datasets demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, we apply the proposed algorithm to image segmentation including texture images and synthetic aperture radar images, the experimental results show the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared with other five algorithms.

AB In this paper a new stochastic-heuristic methodology for the optimisation of the electrical supply of stand-alone (off-grid) hybrid systems (photovoltaic-wind-diesel with battery storage) is shown. The objective is to minimise the net present cost of the system. The stochastic optimisation is developed by means of Monte Carlo simulation, which takes into account the uncertainties of irradiation, temperature, wind speed and load (correlated Gaussian random variables), using their probability density functions and the variance-covariance matrix. Also the uncertainty of diesel fuel price inflation rate was considered. The heuristic approach uses genetic algorithms to obtain the optimal system (or a solution near the optimal) in a reasonable computation time. This methodology includes an accurate weighted All throughput battery model with several control variables, which can be set in the modern battery controllers or inverter/chargers with State of Charge control. A case study is analysed as an example of the application of this methodology, obtaining the stochastic optimisation an optimal system similar to the one obtained by the deterministic optimisation. It is recommended to perform first the deterministic optimisation (with low computation time), then the search space should be reduced and finally the stochastic optimisation can be obtained in a reasonable computation time.

AB Hospitals are critical elements of health care systems and analyzing their capacity and productivity is a very important topic. To perform a system wide analysis of public hospital resources and capacity, a multi-objective optimization (MOO) approach has been proposed. This approach identifies the theoretical capacity of the entire hospital and facilitates a sensitivity analysis, for example of the patient case mix (PCM). It is necessary because the competition for hospital resources, for example between different patient types and hospital units, is highly influential on the hospitals productivity. The MOO approach has been extensively tested on a real life case study and significant worth is shown. In this MOO approach, the epsilon constraint method (ECM) has been utilized. However, for solving real life applications, with a large number of competing objectives, it was necessary to devise new and improved algorithms. In addition, to identify the best solution, a separable programming approach was developed. Multiple optimal solutions are also obtained via the iterative refinement and re-solution of the model.

AB The obsolescence and related energy inefficiency of many industrial processes are currently an obstacle in the transition toward a more sustainable manufacturing sector. The objective of this work is to exploit the advantages of technology updating for improving the economic and environmental performance of the cement industry. To this end, we have developed a mathematical approach to optimize technological updating decisions of existing cement supply chains. Our approach is based on a multiobjective mixed-integer linear programming formulation that determines whether technological updating projects should be undertaken at a given manufacturing stage, such that both environmental and financial goals are best met. A test instance based on a cement supply chain is solved to illustrate how significant benefits can be attained by applying our systematic approach.

AB The change of hydrological regimes may cause impacts on human and natural system. Therefore, investigation of hydrologic alteration induced by climate change is essential for preparing timely proper adaptation to the changes. This study employed 24 climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 scenario. The climate projections were downscaled at a station-spacing for seven Korean catchments by a statistical downscaling method that preserves a long-term trend in climate projections. Using an ensemble of future hydrologic projections simulated by three conceptual rainfall-runoff models (GR4J, IHACRES, and Sacramento models), we calculated Hydrologic Alteration Factors (HAFs) to investigate degrees of variations in Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHAs) derived from the hydrologic projections. The results showed that the seven catchments had similar trend in terms of the HAFs for the 24 IHAs. Given that more frequent severe floods and droughts were projected over Korean catchments, sound water supply strategies are definitely required to adapt to the alteration of streamflow. A wide range of HAFs between rainfall-runoff models for each catchment was detected by large variations in the magnitude of HAFs with the hydrologic models and the difference could be the hydrologic prediction uncertainty. There were no-consistent tendency in the order of HAFs between the hydrologic models. In addition, we found that the alterations of hydrologic regimes by climate change are smaller as the size of catchment is larger. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Reconstructing Networks from Profit Sequences in Evolutionary Games via

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

ID COMPLEX NETWORK; TIME-SERIES; ALGORITHM; PREDICTION; FLOW
AB Evolutionary games (EG) model a common type of interactions in various complex, networked, natural and social systems. Given such a system with only profit sequences being available, reconstructing the interacting structure of EG networks is fundamental to understand and control its collective dynamics. Existing approaches used to handle this problem, such as the lasso, a convex optimization method, need a user-defined constant to control the tradeoff between the natural sparsity of networks and measurement error (the difference between observed data and simulated data). However, a shortcoming of these approaches is that it is not easy to determine these key parameters which can maximize the performance. In contrast to these approaches, we first model the EG network reconstruction problem as a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP), and then develop a framework which involves multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), followed by solution selection based on knee regions, termed as MOEANet, to solve this MOP. We also design an effective initialization operator based on the lasso for MOEA. We apply the proposed method to reconstruct various types of synthetic and real-world networks, and the results show that our approach is effective to avoid the above parameter selecting problem and can reconstruct EG networks with high accuracy.

AB This work presents a novel multiobjective optimization model for bitumen upgrading operations. The proposed model considers five basic upgrading stages; which are the base of any bitumen/heavy oil upgrading operation. These stages include: primary distillation, vacuum distillation, cracking, hydrotreating, and blending. The model includes different processing units per upgrading stage. Each unit includes a set of operating modes; which are defined in terms of particular products yield and energy requirements. The proposed model takes into account two competing objective functions that must be minimized: 1) operating energy costs, and 2) associated CO2 emissions. The optimization approach seeks for the optimal bitumen upgrading configuration by selecting the most suitable upgrading steps based on their corresponding unit's operating modes. This is done to obtain a particular type of synthetic crude oil (SCO) blend according to composition specifications. The problem was modeled as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) using the GAMS modeling system. The model was validated using historical data of the Canadian heavy oil industry. The results show that the proposed model is a practical tool to (1) select and plan the most suitable bitumen upgrading configuration according to product specifications, (2) determine the upgrading energy costs, (3) and mitigate CO2 emissions.

AB Biomass based energy production has been considered as a part of the solution to energy crisis, which is mainly caused by diminishing fossil fuel resources and environmental pollution from traditional fossil fuel based energy production systems. Therefore, it is important to design sustainable and effective systems for biomass based energy production to provide competitive advantage on fossil fuel resourced systems. This study develops a novel optimization model to aid investment planning and strategic management of biomass based clean power generation systems. The model integrates the location, capacity and technology decisions to find the optimal combination of bioenergy production systems to meet electricity demand of particular regions and accounts for multiple biomass types and power technologies. The modelling approach and data analysis are presented to outline the important characteristics of the problem for minimization of the supply chain cost and minimization of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions simultaneously. To handle the multi objective problem efficiently, an integrated approach based on fuzzy decision making and epsilon-constraint method is proposed and used, considering both sustainability aspects and uncertainties in the system parameters. The viability of the proposed approach is explored on a case study of Izmir region in Turkey. Different supply chain configuration alternatives are provided for the case study region considering various weights for objective functions representing relative importance of each objective. Corresponding supply chain performance measures in terms of total cost and GHG emissions are proposed and discussed for each configuration alternative. Further enviro-economic analyses denote that discounted investment cost and GHG emissions associated with energy production activities receive the biggest shares in the total cost and in the total GHG emissions, respectively. The government and private investors can employ the model and solution algorithm to design the most cost effective and environment friendly supply chain, to monitor the economic and environmental performance of the current biomass based supply chains and identify policies to support a viable, profitable and eco-friendly energy industry.

AB The integration of energy efficiency at both machine tool and shop floor levels could bring multiple environmental benefits. In order to explore the potential on energy saving for shop floor management, a multi-level optimization method for energy-efficient flexible flow shop scheduling is proposed, which incorporates power models of single machine and cutting parameters optimization into the energy efficient scheduling problems. The operation scheme is obtained through multi-level optimization, namely cutting parameters optimization (machine tool level) and optimized scheduling (shop floor level). At machine tool level, cutting parameters of each machine are optimized based on grey relational analysis, where cutting energy and cutting time are considered as the objectives. Based on the established energy consumption model of flexible flow shop, Genetic Algorithm is employed to optimize makespan and total energy consumption simultaneously at shop floor level. The case study for a flexible flow shop is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed multi-level optimization method. The scheduling results show that the multi-level optimization method is effective in assisting schemes selection to reduce the makespan and total energy consumption during production process. Moreover, there exists potential for synergistic energy saving when the multi-level optimization is used. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Community structure is an important feature in complex networks which has great significant for organization of networks. The community detection is the process of partitioning the network into some communities in such a way that there exist many connections in the communities and few connections between them. In this paper a Michigan memetic algorithm; called MLAMA-Net; is proposed for solving the community detection problem. The proposed algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm in which each chromosome represents a part of the solution and the whole population represents the solution. In the proposed algorithm, the population of chromosomes is a network of chromosomes which is isomorphic to the input network. Each node has a chromosome and a learning automaton (LA). The chromosome represents the community of corresponding node and saves the histories of exploration. The learning automaton represents a meme and saves the histories of the exploitation. The proposed algorithm is a distributed algorithm in which each chromosome locally evolves by evolutionary operators and improves by a local search. By interacting with both the evolutionary operators and local search, our algorithm effectively detects the community structure in complex networks and solves the resolution limit problem of modularity optimization. To show the superiority of our proposed algorithm over the some well-known algorithms, several computer experiments have been conducted. The obtained results show MLAMA-Net is effective and efficient at detecting the community structure in complex networks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the severe damages to transmission systems caused by ice storms, reasonable de-icing work becomes pressingly significant for power systems. This study proposes a transmission line de-icing outage optimal scheduling framework based on DC de-icing method. First, an ice thickness prediction model and a time-varying forced outage rate model are introduced to delineate the ice accretion and the reliability of lines. Then, a multi-objective de-icing outage optimal problem is formulated to minimise the ice thickness peak value of icing lines and the expected energy not supplied of the system during the decision period. Finally, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II optimisation approach is used to determine the Pareto optimal solutions, and a decision making method is utilised to choose the final de-icing scheme. Simulation results on IEEE 24-bus reliability tests system show the effectiveness of the proposed de-icing strategy.

In this context, physics-based dynamic models can constitute a significant tool for the further development of the technology, allowing to evaluate and optimize response times during transients, or to implement and test innovative control strategies. In this contribution, the dynamic model of an ORC power unit based on the ThermoCycle Modelica library is validated against steady-state and transient experimental results from an 11 kW(el) stationary ORC system. The simulation results are in good agreement with the measurements, both in steady-state and in transient conditions. The validated library is readily usable to investigate demanding dynamics-based problems for low capacity power systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Integrated power plants in "dual purpose" configuration may represent a viable option for energy cost abatement of desalted water produced by MED-TVC (Multiple Effect Distillation along with Thermal Vapour Compression). In this paper an existing large MED-TVC plant with a 36,000 m(3)/day capacity is studied: a plant retrofit is designed, based on a steam power plant with condensation and steam extraction used to drive the steam ejector. As the plant operates in CHP (Combined Heat and Power) mode, the possibility to assess the integrated "CHP + MED-TVC" as high efficiency cogeneration according to Directive 2004/8/EC is discussed. Based on a model developed in Engineering Equation Solver, a sensitivity analysis is performed: the influence of several design and operation parameters on the fraction of energy outputs assessed as "from efficient cogeneration" is investigated. This fraction was found to increase almost linearly with the number of MED units supplied with steam. Also, when all the MED units are supplied and the steam extraction pressure is decreased from 4.89 MPa down to 0.29 MPa, the CHP fraction increased from similar to 54% to similar to 77%. The assessment of the plant as "high efficiency CHP" was found highly dependent on the specific fuel adopted. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There has been an increasing demand for rapid and sensitive techniques for the identification and quantification of pharmaceutical compounds in human biofluids during the past few decades, and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is one of a number of physicochemical techniques with the potential to meet these demands. In this study we have developed a SERS-based analytical approach for the assessment of human biofluids in combination with chemometrics. This novel approach has enabled the detection and quantification of the beta-blocker propranolol spiked into human serum, plasma, and urine at physiologically relevant concentrations. A range of multivariate statistical analysis techniques, including principal component analysis (PCA), principal component discriminant function analysis (PC-DFA) and partial least-squares regression (PLSR) were employed to investigate the relationship between the full SERS spectral data and the level of propranolol. The SERS spectra when combined with PCA and PC-DFA demonstrated clear differentiation of neat biofluids and biofluids spiked with varying concentrations of propranolol ranging from 0 to 120 mu M, and clear trends in ordination scores space could be correlated with the level of propranolol. Since PCA and PC-DFA are categorical classifiers, PLSR modeling was subsequently used to provide accurate propranolol quantification within all biofluids with high prediction accuracy (expressed as root-mean-square error of predictions) of 0.58, 9.68, and 1.69 for serum, plasma, and urine respectively, and these models also had excellent linearity for the training and test sets between 0 and 120 mu M. The limit of detection as calculated from the area under the naphthalene ring vibration from propranolol was 133.1 ng/mL (0.45 mu M), 156.8 ng/mL (0.53 mu M), and 168.6 ng/mL (0.57 mu M) for serum, plasma, and urine, respectively. This result shows a consistent signal irrespective of biofluid, and all are well within the expected physiological level of this drug during therapy. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of SERS application as a diagnostic screening method, following further validation and optimization to improve detection of pharmaceutical compounds and quantification in human biofluids, which may open up new exciting opportunities for future use in various biomedical and forensic applications.

AB In the electricity market, demand response programs are designed to shift peak demand and enhance system reliability. A demand response program can reduce peak energy demand, power transmission congestion, or high energy-price conditions by changing consumption patterns. The purpose of this research is to analyze the impact of a demand response program in the energy market, under demand uncertainty. A stochastic-multiobjective Nash-Cournot competition model is formulated to simulate demand response in an uncertain energy market. Then, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions and a linear complementarity problem are derived for the stochastic Nash-Cournot model. Accordingly, the linear complementarity problem is solved and its stochastic market equilibrium solution is determined by using a general algebraic modeling system. Additionally, the case of the Taiwanese electric power market is taken up here, and the results show that a demand response program is capable of reducing peak energy consumption, energy price, and carbon dioxide emissions. The results show that demand response program decreases electricity price by 2-10%, total electricity generation by 0.5-2%, and carbon dioxide emissions by 0.5-2.5% in the Taiwanese power market. In the simulation, demand uncertainty leads to an 2-7% increase in energy price and supply risk in the market. Additionally, trade-offs between cost and carbon dioxide emissions are presented.

AB A bi-objective model for the design of daily routes over a planning period is analyzed. This model is proposed in response to a real problem encountered by a chemical analysis company located in Salamanca, (Spain). In order to improve its schedule for client visits, the company faced a two-level problem: first, to determine the days for client visits ("visit calendar") for each client during the planning period, and then to design the corresponding daily routes. To do so, two objectives were considered: minimization of transport costs and minimization of the number of changes to the existing calendar of visits. This model could be considered as a variant of the well-known periodic vehicle-routing problem (PVRP) with two objectives. A solution method that combines tabu search and MOAMP (Multiobjective Adaptive Memory Programming) strategies is proposed for this model. Also this method is compared with an adaptation of NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm), a well-known strategy to multi-objective optimization. The computational results show that the MOAMP-Tabu Search method performs better. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Painting with Light is a user-guided interactive evolutionary system for daylighting design. It allows architects to use color to specify desired light levels in spaces, and searches for solutions that bring building geometry and materials close to performance targets. The proposed interface addresses a main limitation of generative design systems based on building performance metrics, by allowing the user to specify daylight spatial patterns with a high degree of granularity. This development poses new challenges for both objective function and penalty function definitions. Painting with Light automatically computes and displays statistical indexes that inform the user on the deviation error between the performance of the solution found by the system and the desired targets. The system was implemented in Python on top of a popular Computer-Aided Design software, Rhinoceros, as an add-on to its Visual Programming Language, Grasshopper. This choice of implementation allows access to Grasshopper's built-in functions and methods for 3D parametric modeling, to tools that provide direct access to Radiance, a lighting simulation software, and to different types of genetic algorithms. Five experiments were conducted on a freeform parametric model for progressive system calibration, which encompassed four steps: 1) adjustment of painted targets to fit the problem feasible solution space; 2) devise appropriate weights and penalty factors for the fitness function; 3) test two different evolutionary solvers; 4) test the system's capability to find a predefined solution where the optimal values were known. After calibration, the system was able to produce solutions that closely approximate the painted goals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As a class of widely observed materials in nature, hierarchical micro structures maybe of superior mechanical properties. In this study, we incorporate the concept of hierarchy into honeycomb structures for enhancing their crashworthiness performance. Hierarchical honeycombs are constructed by replacing every vertex of a regular hexagonal network with a smaller hexagon topology and repeating this process for constructing fractal-appearing honeycombs with higher order of structural hierarchy. To examine the crashing characteristics the hierarchical honeycombs with the first-order and second-order structures were investigated under an out of the cross-sectional plane loading. A parametric study on structural variables (gamma(1), gamma(2)) which were defined by gamma(i) = L-i / L-0 (L-0 was the edge length of regular honeycomb cell, Li was the edge length of i-th order hexagon in hierarchical honeycombs) and oblique-wall angles gamma which was defined by the angle of oblique-wall edge to the vertical direction were undertaken with three different densities. A comparison between regular honeycombs and hierarchical honeycombs was conducted. The results showed that the out-of-plane energy absorption of the first-order hierarchical honeycombs with 0.04 = gamma(1) = 0.2 and the second-order hierarchical honeycombs with 0.15 <= gamma(1) <= 0.2 and 0.04 <= gamma(2) <= 0.08, as well as the hierarchical honeycombs with oblique-wall angle gamma from 30 degrees to 50 degrees have better overall performance. Further, it is found that the specific energy absorptions (SEA) of the first-order hierarchy with gamma(1) = 0.08 and the second-order hierarchy with gamma(1) <= 0.20, gamma(2) <= 0.06 were improved about 81.3% and 185.7%, respectively. Moreover, their corresponding peak forces (P-max) do not increase much compared with the regular honeycomb under the same density, indicating that hierarchical honeycombs can be an ideal lightweight structure for designing crashworthy structures.

AB This paper deals with an optimal control for the reverse osmosis (RO) desalination process of a pilot desalination plant equipped with a high pressure pump and a retentate valve and operated by renewable solar energy. The goal of the optimal control is to maximize the permeate production, with constraints on the trans-membrane pressure on the RO membrane and the total dissolved solids of permeate, by joint control of the duty of the high pressure pump and the openness of the retentate valve. The trans-membrane pressure, the total dissolved solids of permeate, and the permeate production rate are empirically modeled by two-dimensional second order equations in terms of the duty and the openness. The duty and the openness providing the maximum permeate production rate with the constraints satisfied are found by the two-dimensional genetic algorithm (GA). This joint control is different from other existing approaches which separately control the duty and the openness. Time-varying behaviors of the trans-membrane pressure, the total dissolved solids of permeate, and the production rate obtained by the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control are shown with those by the two-dimensional GA. The two-dimensional GA achieves maximum permeate production rate while satisfying the constraints, even when the PID control fails. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A new method to improve pure compound parameters estimation for SAFT EoS is proposed and applied to PC-SAFT. The method consists in using information from a sensitivity analysis to define an improved variable-weight cost function and fixing the least sensitive parameter. Using temperature dependent weights and fixing the least sensitive parameter, the model is fitted with a cost function skewed toward the properties and temperature ranges where the EoS is more sensitive. To assess this approach, the performance of parameters fitted with a classical unweighted cost function were compared with that of parameters fitted with the new approach. Results from four 1-alkanols and four n-alkylamines show that parameters fitted with the proposed methodology, when compared with those fitted with the classical method, correlate non-associating parameters with molecular mass better. In addition, they fit and predict mixture properties more accurately. Average binary VLE fitting error in liquid composition was reduced from 7.2% to 6.5% and in vapour composition from 3.6% to 3.1%. In addition, mixture liquid density prediction error was reduced from 0.53% to 0.31%. Finally, ternary VLE average prediction error was reduced 15% for vapour compositions and 43% for temperature.

AB Typically performed by supervised machine learning algorithms, sentiment analysis is highly useful for extracting subjective information from text documents online. Most approaches that use ensemble learning paradigms toward sentiment analysis involve feature engineering in order to enhance the predictive performance. In response, we sought to develop a paradigm of a multiobjective, optimization-based weighted voting scheme to assign appropriate weight values to classifiers and each output class based on the predictive performance of classification algorithms, all to enhance the predictive performance of sentiment classification. The proposed ensemble method is based on static classifier selection involving majority voting error and forward search, as well as a multiobjective differential evolution algorithm. Based on the static classifier selection scheme, our proposed ensemble method incorporates Bayesian logistic regression, naive Bayes, linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and support vector machines as base learners, whose performance in terms of precision and recall values determines weight adjustment. Our experimental analysis of classification tasks, including sentiment analysis, software defect prediction, credit risk modeling, spam filtering, and semantic mapping, suggests that the proposed classification scheme can predict better than conventional ensemble learning methods such as AdaBoost, bagging, random subspace, and majority voting. Of all datasets examined, the laptop dataset showed the best classification accuracy (98.86%). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Energy is needed in all sectors: industrial, domestic, commercial, transportation, power generation. Fossil fuel has been the main source of energy since decades. Due to rising greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, the energy mix in many countries are shifting towards alternative energy sources, such as renewable energy and nuclear. At the same time, energy demands should also be managed and minimised to curb the rising GHG. Transitioning towards cleaner energy supply may also take time due to economic, political, technology readiness and public acceptance reason. A faster solution is to sequestrate CO2 especially through CO2 capture, utilisation and storage technologies. This paper presents an overview of the Journal of Cleaner Production Special Volume for the 18th conference "Process Integration, Modelling and Optimisation for Energy Saving and Pollution Reduction (PRES 2015)". The paper discussed issues, methods and solutions to achieve cleaner energy. The review has been written from the perspective of the supply side management, demand side management or end-of pipe management. The content of the Special Volume also includes cleaner energy planning, policies and education. The Special Volume reviews various ideas and discussion from authors all over the world and also provides some directions for future studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biomass is a renewable resource that has attractive characteristics for energy production, but the corresponding supply chain could be subject of several uncertain factors that can affect drastically the optimal configuration, and those have not been properly accounted in previous publications. Therefore, this work presents a new approach for the optimal planning under uncertainty for a biomass conversion system involving simultaneously economic and environmental issues. The environmental impact was measured via the Eco-indicator99 method and the economic aspect was determined through the net annual profit. The proposed method considered the uncertainty involved in the raw material price by the stochastic generation of scenarios using the Latin Hypercube method followed by the implementation of the Monte-Carlo method, where a deterministic optimization problem was solved for each single scenario to select the structure of the more robust supply chain relying on statistical data. The proposed approach was applied to a case study for a distributed biorefinery system in Mexico. The results showed that the behavior of the profit values for the stochastic case is not associated to the behavior of the raw material price; also, it is possible to observe that the supply chain topology could be affected for the uncertainty in the raw material price; however, the environmental and economic objectives did not present significant changes.

AB Non-dominated sorting has widely been adopted and shown to be very effective in dominance based evolutionary multi-objective optimization where the number of objectives is two or three. In. dealing with many-objective optimization problems, where the number of objectives is more than three, however, the effectiveness of dominance based evolutionary algorithms will seriously degrade and the computational complexity of non dominated sorting will considerably increase. In this paper, we propose an approximate non-dominated sorting algorithm for many-objective optimization, where the dominance relationship between two solutions is determined by a maximum of three objective comparisons on top of a sorted population according to one of the objectives. The time complexity of the proposed approximate sorting is independent of the number of objectives, which significantly enhances the time efficiency, in particular when the number of objectives is large. To examine the influence of inaccurate sorting on the search performance, the proposed approximate sorting method is embedded in three popular dominance based evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithms. Our experimental results on 16 widely used many-objective optimization benchmark problems suggest that the approximate non-dominated sorting method is not only computationally much more efficient than the state-of-the-art accurate non-dominated sorting methods, but also leads to better search performance on most test problems used in this study.

AB Despite the advantages of distributed generations (DGs) in electrical networks, they make some unwanted changes in network short-circuit levels which make new security risks arise. This imposes several new scenarios on the network operation in the presence of DGs. In addition to the mentioned security concerns, reducing network loss is among the objectives constantly sought by system operators. Therefore, this study discusses both the reconfiguration of a distribution network for efficient operation and protection coordination in the form of a multi-objective optimisation problem. The aforementioned objectives include reducing losses and maintaining short-circuit levels under several utilisation scenarios of DGs. Thus, the optimal reconfiguration of the network is simultaneously considered along with the optimal planning of fault current limiters through a two-stage stochastic programming. A fuzzy system is utilised to solve the multi-objective problem and a fuzzy imperialism competitive algorithm is proposed to reach the global optimum. The proposed model is implemented on IEEE 69-bus and a real life 77-bus system. Simulation results confirm that implementing the proposed technique not only reduces power losses, but also maintains a short-circuit level of the network under probable utilisation scenarios which in turn the protection coordination of system is improved.

AB The effect of washcoat properties is theoretically investigated for steam methane reforming (SMR) in a plate microchannel reactor. Transport phenomena and reaction within the catalytic washcoat and in the bulk gas phase are modeled using a two-dimensional, comprehensive CFD model with fully resolved catalytic washcoat, coupled with detailed chemistry for SMR over Ni catalyst. Simulation results show that the process is governed by internal mass transfer and reaction, therefore the reactor performance depends markedly on the washcoat structure and dimension. Increasing pore size of the washcoat leads to improved heat coupling, which lowers the hotspot temperature and reduces axial temperature gradients. In the meantime, the role of porosity remains trivial. Further, using a thicker washcoat carrying a greater loading of catalyst can considerably increase the reactor throughput within washcoat thickness of 75 gm, at the expense of certain loss of the catalyst productivity. Optimized washcoat properties would rely on the catalyst activity, price and specific process demands. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Computational process models in combination with innovative design methodologies provide a powerful reactor design platform. Yet, model-based design is mostly done in a pure deterministic way. Possible uncertainties of the underlying model parameters, prediction errors due to simplifying assumptions regarding the reactor behavior and suboptimal realizations of the design along the reaction coordinate are in general not considered. Here we propose a systematic design approach to directly account for the impact of such variabilities during the design procedure. The three level design approach of Peschel et al. (2010) based on the concept of elementary process functions (EPF) serves as basis. The dynamic optimizations on each level are extended within a probabilistic framework to account for different sources of randomness. The impact of these sources on the performance prediction of a design is quantified and used to robustify the reactor design aiming at a more reliable performance and thus design prediction. The uncertainties of model parameters, non-idealities of the reactor behavior and inaccuracies in the design are included via statistical moments. By means of the sigma point method (Julier and Uhlmann, 1996) random variables are mapped to the design objective space via the nonlinear process model. Importantly, this work introduces a full probabilistic orthogonal collocation approach, i.e. random and stochastic variables can be described. Whereas the former one relates to randomness independent on the reaction time (e.g. kinetic model parameters or initial conditions), the latter one describes stochasticity along the reaction time (e.g. fluctuating pressure or temperature control). As an example process the hydroformylation of 1-dodecene in a thermomorphic solvent system consisting of n-decane and N,N-dimethylformamide is considered.
   Our probabilistic EPF approach allows designing robust optimal reactors, which operate within an estimated confidence at their expected optimum considering almost any kind of randomness arising in the design procedure. An additional value is that with increased predictive power of the reactor performance its embedding in an overall process is strongly simplified. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper deals with accelerating typical optimization scenarios for electrical machine designs. Besides the advantage of a reduced computation time, this leads to a reduction in computational power and thus to a lower power consumption when running the optimization. If machines of high power density are required, usually highly utilized assemblies that feature nonlinear characteristics are obtained. Optimization scenarios are considered where the evaluation of a potential design requires computationally expensive nonlinear finite element (FE) simulations. Improving the speed of optimization runs takes top priority and various measures can be considered. This paper is about basic and easily achievable measures, and techniques for a time-wise and computationally efficient exploration of the design space. Suggested improvements comprise sophisticated emerging techniques for modeling machine characteristics by paring the number of required FE simulations down to the minimum and nonlinear modeling of the targets of the optimization scenario as functions of the design parameters to further reduce the number of FE evaluations. In the case study, the analysis of a typical optimization task is given, and achievable speed improvements as well as still present issues are discussed.

TI A Sequential Robust Optimization Approach for Multidisciplinary Design
   Optimization With Uncertainty
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN
LA English
DT Article

ID MULTIOBJECTIVE ROBUST; SYSTEM
AB One real challenge for multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) problems to gain a robust solution is the propagation of uncertainty from one discipline to another. Most existing methods only consider an MDO problem in the deterministic manner or find a solution which is robust for a single-disciplinary optimization problem. These rare methods for solving MDO problems under uncertainty are usually computationally expensive. This paper proposes a robust sequential MDO (RS-MDO) approach based on a sequential MDO (S-MDO) framework. First, a robust solution is obtained by giving each discipline full autonomy to perform optimization without considering other disciplines. A tolerance range is specified for each coupling variable to take care of uncertainty propagation in the coupled system. Then the obtained robust extreme points of global variables and coupling variables are dispatched into subsystems to perform robust optimization (RO) sequentially. Additional constraints are added in each subsystem to keep the consistency and to guarantee a robust solution. To find a solution with such strict constraints, genetic algorithm (GA) is used as a solver in each optimization stage. The proposed RS-MDO can save significant amount of computational efforts by using the sequential optimization procedure. Since all iterations in the sequential optimization stage can be processed in parallel, this robust MDO approach can be more time-saving. Numerical and engineering examples are provided to demonstrate the availability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Nature conservation and ecological restoration crucially depends on the knowledge about spatial patterns of plant species that control habitat conversion and disturbance regimes. Especially, species abundances are capable of indicating early development tendencies for setting habitat management strategies. This study demonstrates the transfer of field spectroscopy to hyperspectral imagery to map multiple plant species abundances in an open dryland area using two imaging spectrometers in two different phenological phases. We show that species abundances can partially be described by multiple gradients forming different coordinates in a contour map. For this purpose, species abundances were projected into an ordination space using non-metric multidimensional scaling and subsequent spatial interpolation. It was demonstrated that different gradients can be modeled in a Partial Least Squares regression framework resulting in distinct spectral features for certain gradient directions. We combine both objectives in a multiobjective NSGA-II procedure to maximize the quantitative determination of species abundance in ordination and spectral predictability in related field spectra, simultaneously. NSGA-II was finally used to select optimal spectral models for n = 35 single species that were transferred to hyperspectral imagery for mapping purpose. We can show that abundance predictabilities can be evaluated on the basis of individual model performances that hold different spectral features for each species in a designated phenological phase. Finally, we present spatially explicit multi-species maps for the best n = 18 and abundance maps for n = 8 models that could be linked to patterns of species richness, coexistence, succession stages and habitat type conditions.

AB The present study aimed to develop the predictive models of average tool-workpiece interface temperature in hard turning of AISI 1060 steels by coated carbide insert. The Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were employed to predict the temperature in respect of cutting speed, feed rate and material hardness. The number and orientation of the experimental trials, conducted i both dry and high pressure coolant (HPC) environments, were planned using nfull factorial design. The temperature was measured by using the tool-work thermocouple. In RSM model, two quadratic equations of temperature were derived from experimental data. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were performed to suffice the adequacy of the models. In ANN model, 80% data were used to train and 20% data were employed for testing. Like RSM, herein, the error analysis was also conducted. The accuracy of the RSM and ANN model was found to be P99%. The ANN models exhibit an error of similar to 5% MAE for testing data. The regression coefficient was found to be greater than 99.9% for both dry and HPC. Both these models are acceptable, although the ANN model demonstrated a higher accuracy. These models, if employed, are expected to provide a better control of cutting temperature in turning of hardened steel.

   chemical reaction optimization; Decomposition approach
ID OBJECTIVE REDUCTION; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; SEARCH; MOEA/D
AB Multiobjective optimization is an essential and challenging topic in the domains of science and engineering optimization. An effective decomposition-based chemical reaction optimization metaheuristic algorithm (MOCRO/D) for solving multiobjective optimization problems (MOPS) is proposed in this paper. In the proposed algorithm, each decomposed sub-problem is represented by a chemical molecule. All molecules are divided into a few groups and each molecule has several neighboring molecules. During the search, each molecule records its potential energy (optimal solution), the hits of number and the kinetic energy. MOCRO/D has four operators, i.e., on-wall ineffective collision, inter-molecular ineffective collision, decomposition, and synthesis. To explore the search space efficiently, polynomial mutation and multiple molecule collision operators are introduced in the inter-molecular collision and synthesis operator. The inter-molecular ineffective collision operator uses three molecules to collide, which can improve the information interacting with each other with a certain probability. The extended synthesis operator could increase the global search ability. Extended operators for MOCRO/D (MOECRO/D) are proposed that can better optimize the variables related problems. The proposed approach is compared with other metaheuristic algorithms available in the specialized literature. Results indicate that the proposed approach is competitive in most of the test instances. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The maturing mechanism improves growth and reduces redundancy. The performance of MO-mHGS with selected state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms as internal algorithms is analysed on benchmark problems and their modifications for which single fitness evaluation time depends on the solution accuracy. We compare the proposed algorithm with the Island Model Genetic Algorithm as well as with single-deme methods, and discuss the impact of internal algorithms on the MO-mHGS meta-algorithm.

AB Steam methane reforming is an endothermic reaction which is considered as one of the main processes in hydrogen and syngas production. This process has been modelled and optimized in the present study using design of experiment and response surface methodology. The hydrogen production and unreacted methane mole fractions are considered as two responses. Temperature, pressure and flowrate of input feed, tube wall temperature, steam to methane ratio, and hydrogen to methane ratio in the input feed are considered as the independent factors, and their effects on the responses have been studied. Finally, the optimum values of independent factors and responses are reported. The average error was about 7%, which shows the presented model has an acceptable validity. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB Old industrial bases in Northeastern China have been experiencing a series of problems such as energy scarcity, economic slack and environmental pollution due to lack of scientific planning of energy systems. Effective energy system management is desirable for avoiding occurrence of these problems in the following decades under the national policy of revitalizing these industrial bases. This task is challenged by system complexity, data unavailability, and inaccurate demand forecasting which can hardly be resolved in existing studies. For improving energy system management in Qiqihar City, a representative industrial base in Northeastern China, under these challenges, a large-scale and fine-resolution Bayesian interval robust energy system optimization (BIRESO) approach is developed in this study. In detail, the structure, characteristics, problems and complexities of the energy system in this city are identified and analyzed. Based on these efforts, a series of optimized energy system management schemes are generated through construction of a BIRESO model and development of a solution algorithm. The obtained solutions can be ensured to remain robust when input data changes through controlling the degree of solution conservatism in accordance with probabilistic bounds on constraint violation. Furthermore, Bayesian estimation method was employed for effectively achieving dynamic forecast of energy demands. The tradeoff among energy security, economic development and environmental conservation under multiple uncertainties is revealed, and the optimal balance among them is identified. A scenario analysis approach is used to quantify the effects of economic growth on energy system schemes based on several developed scenarios. Results show that the BIRESO approach is capable of providing scientific support for energy supply planning, renewable energy development, technological advancement, facility expansion, energy allocation, pollution control, economic impacts assessment, and other energy related activities in Qiqihar City.

AB In order to reduce casualties and property losses in a collision accident, thin-walled structure has been extensively used as energy absorber in crashworthiness design of train. With the help of energy absorber, collision kinetic energy can be controllably dissipated by the plastic deformation of structures. A new kind of multi-cell thin-walled structure called as bitubular polygonal tubes with internal walls (BPTIW) was constructed. The crashworthiness characteristics of BPTIWs were investigated by LS-DYNA. It can be found that the BPTIW with 12 sides has the most excellent crashworthiness characteristics. Therefore, based on response surface method (RSM) and multiobjective particle optimization (MOPSO) algorithm, the BPTIW with 12 sides was selected to optimize the dimensions of cross-sectional configuration under different constraints of energy absorption (EA) and crushing peak force (CPF). The results show that the optimal designs of BPTIW12 under different constraints present excellent crashworthiness characteristics and can be used in the practical engineering.

AB Cogeneration is the simultaneous generation of electricity and useful heat with the aim of exploiting more efficiently the energy stored in the fuel. Cogeneration is, however, a complex process that encompasses a great amount of sub-systems and variables. This fact makes it very difficult to obtain an analytical model of the whole plant, and therefore providing a mechanism or a methodology able to optimize the global behavior. This paper proposes a neuro-genetic strategy for modeling and optimizing a cogeneration process of a real industrial plant. Firstly, the modeling of the process is carried out by means of several interconnected neural networks where, each neural network deals with a particular sub-system of the plant. Next, the obtained models are used by a genetic algorithm, which solves a multiobjective optimization problem of the plant, where the goal is to minimize the fuel consumption and maximize both the generated electricity and the use of the heat. The proposed approach is evaluated with data of a real cogeneration plant collected over a one-year period. Obtained results show not only that the modeling of the plant is correct but also that the optimization increases significantly the efficiency of the cogeneration plant. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, a novel CMOQPSO algorithm is proposed, in which cultural evolution mechanism is introduced into quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) to solve multiobjective environmental/economic dispatch (EED) problems. There are growing concerns about the ability of QPSO to handle multiobjective optimization problems. Two important issues in extending QPSO to multiobjective context are the construction of exemplar positions for each particle and the maintenance of population diversity. In the proposed CMOQPSO, one particle is measured for multiple times at each iteration in order to enhance its global searching ability. Belief space, which is based on cultural evolution mechanism and contains different types of knowledge extracted from the particle swarm, is adopted to generate global best positions for the multiple measurements of each particle. Moreover, to maintain population diversity and avoid premature, a novel local search operator, which is based on the knowledge in belief space, is proposed in this paper. CMOQPSO is compared with several state-of-art algorithms and tested on EED systems with 6 and 40 generators respectively. The comparative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A multicriteria identification and prediction method for mathematical models of simulation type in the case of several identification criteria (error functions) is proposed. The necessity of the multicriteria formulation arises, for example, when one needs to take into account errors of completely different origins (not reducible to a single characteristic) or when there is no information on the class of noise in the data to be analyzed. An identification sets method is described based on the approximation and visualization of the multidimensional graph of the identification error function and sets of suboptimal parameters. This method allows for additional advantages of the multicriteria approach, namely, the construction and visual analysis of the frontier and the effective identification set (frontier and the Pareto set for identification criteria), various representations of the sets of Pareto effective and subeffective parameter combinations, and the corresponding predictive trajectory tubes. The approximation is based on the deep holes method, which yields metric e-coverings with nearly optimal properties, and on multiphase approximation methods for the Edgeworth-Pareto hull. The visualization relies on the approach of interactive decision maps. With the use of the multicriteria method, multiple-choice solutions of identification and prediction problems can be produced and justified by analyzing the stability of the optimal solution not only with respect to the parameters (robustness with respect to data) but also with respect to the chosen set of identification criteria (robustness with respect to the given collection of functionals).

AB An innovative double-hat thin-walled beam comprised of aluminum-steel hybrid materials is proposed for potential application in passenger vehicle bumper systems to reduce pedestrian injury. The beams are featuring an aluminum alloy upper hat and a high strength steel lower hat riveted together to increase the specific energy absorption (SEA) and to reduce the initial peak force (F-ip) simultaneously under lateral impacts. Quasi-static three-point bending test was performed to explore the bending resistant characteristics of such a double-hat beam. Furthermore, bending behavior of the hybrid beam under lateral impact was numerically investigated using LS-DYNA and compared with that of its counterparts with homogeneous materials and identical geometrical dimensions. It was found that the aluminum-steel hybrid beam shows a well-balanced and better bending performance under lateral impact compared to beams made of a single material. Parametric studies were further conducted to investigate the influences of critical geometric parameters on the crashworthiness performances of such double-hat beams under lateral impacts. Based on radial basis function (RBF) metamodels and using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), bi-objective optimizations to maximize SEA and minimize F-ip were carried out for both the hybrid and the two homogeneous beams. The optimization results show that the hybrid beam possesses better Pareto solutions than the homogeneous beams, and is more preferable for use in vehicle bumpers. Finally, a tri-objective optimization problem is solved for the hybrid beam to further maximize its bending moment (Mb). It was found that SEA and Mb of the hybrid beam are cooperating with each other and emphasize on different objectives will result in optimal configurations with slight differences.

AB Surface integrity determines the performance and quality of the end product. It often needs to change the input parameters, such as cutting parameter, cutting tool geometry and material, and tool coating, to obtain the best machining surface integrity. This article presents and demonstrates the effectiveness for the multi-objective optimization of cutter geometric parameters for surface integrity of milling Ti-5Al-5Mo-5V-1Cr-1Fe titanium alloy via grey relational analysis coupled with the Taguchi method, entropy weight method, and analytic hierarchy process. The main influence factors are chosen as radial rake angle, primary radial relief angle, and helix angle, while surface roughness and residual stress are taken as performance characteristics. Based on the Taguchi method, an L16 (4(3)) orthogonal array is chosen for the experiments. The effect of cutter geometric parameters on surface roughness and residual stress is analysed by signal-to-noise ratio. Then, the multiple objectives optimization problem is successfully converted to a single-objective optimization of grey relational grade with the grey relational analysis. The weight coefficient for grey relational grade is determined by entropy weight method integrated with analytic hierarchy process. The results show that the order of importance for controllable factor to the milling surface integrity, in sequence, is radial rake angle, primary radial relief angle, and helix angle. The validation experiment verifies that the proposed optimization method has the ability to find out the optimal geometric parameters in terms of milling surface integrity.

AB Vulnerability and resilience are two crucial attributes of social-ecological systems that are used for analyzing the response to disturbances. We assess these properties in relation to agroecosystem buffer capacity and adaptive capacity, which depend on the 'window of opportunities' of possible changes in terms of selected performance indicators, i.e., the solution space. The vulnerability of the system was quantified as the distance of performance indicators between original and disturbed systems. The buffer capacity was derived from the size of the solution space that could be obtained after reconfiguration of farm components (crops, animals, fertilizers, etc.) that were present on the original farm, whereas the assessment of adaptive capacity was derived in a similar way, but after allowing innovation by introducing new components to the farm. To illustrate the approach, we applied these concepts to two dairy farms in Northwest Michoacan, Mexico. After a disturbance resulting in a fodder maize yield decline, both economic profitability and soil organic matter inputs were reduced. The scope for recovery was different between the farms, but the projected improvements in profitability and organic matter inputs would require considerable changes in the farm configurations, and thus flexibility in farm management. High resilience requires a farmer with the managerial ability to make the required changes to move through the proposed solution space. The approach we present here offers a generic quantitative assessment of vulnerability and resilience concepts, based on a combined assessment of the social and ecological dimensions of agroecosystems.

AB The emerging data traffic demand has caused a massive deployment of network infrastructure, including Base Stations ( BSs) and Small Cells ( SCs), leading to increased energy consumption and expenditures. However, the network underutilization during low traffic periods enables the Mobile Network Operators ( MNOs) to save energy by having their traffic served by third party SCs, thus being able to switch off their BSs. In this paper, we propose a novel market approach to foster the opportunistic utilization of the unexploited SCs capacity, where the MNOs, instead of requesting the maximum capacity to meet their highest traffic expectations, offer a set of bids requesting different resources from the third party SCs at lower costs. Motivated by the conflicting financial interests of the MNOs and the third party, the restricted capacity of the SCs that is not adequate to carry the whole traffic in multi-operator scenarios, and the necessity for energy efficient solutions, we introduce a combinatorial auction framework, which includes i) a bidding strategy, ii) a resource allocation scheme, and iii) a pricing rule. We propose a multiobjective framework as an energy and cost efficient solution for the resource allocation problem, and we provide extensive analytical and experimental results to estimate the potential energy and cost savings that can be achieved. In addition, we investigate the conditions under which the MNOs and the third party companies should take part in the proposed auction.

AB The paper presents an electronic tourist guide, relying on an evolutionary optimizer, able to plan personalized multiple-day itineraries by considering several contrasting objectives. Since the itinerary planning can be modeled as an extension of the NP-complete team orienteering problem with time windows, a multiobjective evolutionary optimizer is proposed to find in reasonable times near-optimal solutions to such an extension. This optimizer automatically designs the itinerary by aiming at maximizing the tourists' satisfaction as a function of their personal preferences and environmental constraints, such as operating hours, visiting times and accessibility of the points of interests, and weather forecasting. Experimental evaluations have demonstrated that the proposed optimizer is effective in different simulated operating conditions.

AB This paper describes an evolutionary approach to design flat multiwavelength achromatic lenses based on subwavelength plasmonic nanoparticles. Our lattice evolution algorithm achieved desired optical responses by tuning the arrangement of the phase units on a discrete square lattice. Lattice lenses consisting of a single type of nanoparticle could operate at any wavelength in the visible to near-infrared regime (540-1000 nm) by tailoring the localized surface plasmon resonance. When the unit cells were expanded to anisotropic particle shapes, the planar optics could selectively focus light depending on the polarization of incident light. Finally, the algorithm realized efficient multiobjective optimization and produced achromatic lattice lenses at up to three wavelengths lambda = 600 nm, lambda = 785 nm, and lambda = 980 nm) using multiple different nanoparticle shapes.

AB The objective of this study is to develop a trajectory-optimization method using an efficient time series flight simulation. Equations of motion (EoMs) were solved by estimating the time-series aerodynamics data construction. The aerodynamics of an arbitrary aircraft were estimated according to an aerodynamic database, which improved the efficiency via the Kriging method. To increase the accuracies of aerodynamic databases, additional data sets were acquired. The developed method was applied to the multi-objective problem of trajectory optimization for landing approaches. Two objective functions were considered: the minimization of the cost function, which indicates the optimal profile trajectory, and the minimization of the maximum acceleration. A Kriging model-based exploration with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II was used as an optimizer. According to the results, as well as a comparison of the cases with and without the microburst effect, the microburst effect can potentially cause an overestimation of the aircraft trajectory by minimizing both the cost function and the maximum acceleration. The trajectory thus needs to be corrected to the nearest trajectory without a microburst effect, with optimal control angle and altitude. The trajectory optimization was affected by the initial sampling and additional samples of the aerodynamic database. This study shows the importance of this database for optimizing the trajectory analysis on the basis of the equation of motion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB The Stirling engine presents an excellent theoretical output equivalent to the output of Carnot engine and it is less pollutant and requires little maintenance. In this paper, Stirling heat engine is considered for optimization with multiple criteria. A recently developed advanced optimization algorithm namely "teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm" is used for maximization of output power, minimization of pressure losses and maximization of the thermal efficiency of the entire solar Stirling system. The comparisons of the proposed algorithm are made with those obtained by using the decision-making methods like linear programming technique for multi-dimensional analysis of preference (LINMAP), technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and fuzzy Bellman-Zadeh method that have used the Pareto frontier gained through non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). The comparisons were also made with those obtained by the experimental results. It is found that the TLBO algorithm has produced comparatively better results than those given by the decision-making methods and the experimental results presented by the previous researchers.

AB Several hydraulic modelling approaches have been proposed previously to simulate pressure - deficient operating conditions in water distribution networks more realistically. EPANET-PDX is a pressure-driven extension of the EPANET 2 hydraulic simulation model that has an embedded logistic nodal head-flow function. The pressure-driven analysis algorithm in EPANET-PDX was investigated, to improve its performance under conditions of extremely low pressure. By integrating a line minimization procedure fully in the computational solution of the system of equations, the algorithm's consistency was improved by increasing its computational efficiency under conditions of extremely low pressure. The examples considered demonstrated that the pressure-driven analysis algorithm proposed is robust, computationally efficient, and the line minimization procedure is applied frequently. Overall, the results suggest that the algorithm is reliable. The formulation proposed is significantly faster than the previous model under conditions of extremely low pressure. The hydraulic and water quality modelling functionality of EPANET 2 was preserved. For the operating conditions with satisfactory pressure, where direct comparisons with EPANET 2 were possible, EPANET 2 was consistently faster.

AB Water scarcity threatens economic growth, social cohesion, and environmental sustainability in many deltas. This situation is likely to worsen due to future climate change. To reduce water scarcity and limit salt water intrusion in deltas, many countries have launched policies to allocate water resources. However, it is difficult to develop long-term adaptive water management policies due to large uncertainties. In this paper, we present a Robust Assessment Model for Water Allocation (RAMWA) to support decision making about water release of different key reservoirs under future climate change. The model was applied in the Pearl River basin, China to improve reservoir management, to ensure sufficient flow into the delta to reduce salt intrusion, and to provide sufficient freshwater for human and industrial consumption. Results show that performance of the existing water allocation plans reduces under climate change, as the plans are unable to sustain the required minimum river discharge. However alternatives generated by a Generic Evolutionary Algorithm (GEA) suggest that new plans can be developed which ensure minimum flows into the delta under most future climate change scenarios. The GEA plans perform better than existing plans because rather than following a fixed allocation schedule, the optimal water release for each reservoir is recalculated every 10 days based on observed discharge and storage in key reservoirs.

AB This paper presents a hybrid method integrating modified NSGA-II and TOPSIS, used for lightweight design of the front sub-frame of a passenger car. Firstly, the FE model of the sub-frame is constructed and is validated by modal test. Then, the strength performance of the sub-frame is analyzed under four typical load conditions consisting of braking, acceleration, steady state cornering and vertical bump. After that, a parameterized model of the sub-frame, in which 12 geometric parameters are defined as design variables, is developed based on the mesh morphing technology. Subsequently, modified NSGA-II is employed for multi-objective optimization of the sub-frame considering weight, maximum von-Mises stress and first order natural frequency as three conflicting objective functions. Accordingly, a set of Pareto-optimal solutions are obtained from the optimization process. Finally, the entropy weight theory and TOPSIS method are adopted to rank all these solutions from the best to the worst for determining the best compromise solution. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid lightweight design method is demonstrated by the comparisons among baseline design and optimum solutions.

AB In the optimization design of a pre-bend wind turbine blade, there is a coupling relationship between blade aerodynamic shape and structural layup. The evaluation index of a wind turbine blade not only shows on conventional ones, such as Annual energy production (AEP), cost, and quality, but also includes the size of the loads on the hub or tower. Hence, the design of pre-bend wind turbine blades is a true multi-objective engineering task. To make the integrative optimization design of the pre-bend blade, new methods for the blade's pre-bend profile design and structural analysis for the blade sections were presented, under dangerous working conditions, and considering the fundamental control characteristics of the wind turbine, an integrated aerodynamic-structural design technique for pre-bend blades was developed based on the Multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOPSO). By using the optimization method, a three-dimensional Pareto-optimal set, which can satisfy different matching requirements from overall design of a wind turbine, was obtained. The most suitable solution was chosen from the Pareto-optimal set and compared with the original 1.5 MW blade. The results show that the optimized blade have better performance in every aspect, which verifies the feasibility of this new method for the design of pre-bend wind turbine blades.

AB This paper presents a new model and solution procedure for a problem that arises in configuring package sorting centers that perform multiple automated sorts per day. For a given set of loading bays, the first objective is to assign destinations to consecutive doors so that the number of changes of destination-to-door assignments from one sort to the next is minimized. The second and third objectives are to minimize the number of loaders who work the doors and to evenly distribute the volume of packages assigned to each loader. A variety of constraints vastly complicates these assignments and leads to a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model, which we significantly strengthened with structurally derived cuts. A novel feature of the formulation is the use of pattern variables to represent the door assignments. Taking a multiobjective programming approach, solutions are obtained by solving a series of MIPs, each addressing one of the three objectives. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated using data provided by a well-known package carrier for 24 work centers in four facilities. An additional contribution is a complexity analysis of the destination-to-door and the loader-to-door assignment subproblems. Both are shown to be strongly NP-hard. We also examine special cases of the loader subproblem and develop polynomial-time algorithms for them.

ID COMPUTATIONAL DESIGN
AB Motivation: The design of de novo circuits with predefined performance specifications is a challenging problem in Synthetic Biology. Computational models and tools have proved to be crucial for a successful wet lab implementation. Natural gene circuits are complex, subject to evolutionary tradeoffs and playing multiple roles. However, most synthetic designs implemented to date are simple and perform a single task. As the field progresses, advanced computational tools are needed in order to handle greater levels of circuit complexity in a more flexible way and considering multiple design criteria.
   Results: This works presents SYNBADm (SYNthetic Biology Automated optimal Design in Matlab), a software toolbox for the automatic optimal design of gene circuits with targeted functions from libraries of components. This tool makes use of global optimization to simultaneously search the space of structures and kinetic parameters. SYNBADm can efficiently handle high levels of circuit complexity and can consider multiple design criteria through multiobjective optimization. Further, it provides flexible design capabilities, i.e. the user can define the modeling framework, library of components and target performance function(s).
   Availability and Implementation: SYNBADm runs under the popular MATLAB computational environment, and is available under GPLv3 license at https://sites.google.com/site/synbadm

AB It is complex and difficult to perform the emergency scheduling of forest fires in order to reduce the operational cost and improve the efficiency of extinguishing fire services. A new research issue arises when: 1) decision-makers want to minimize the number of rescue vehicles (or fire-fighting ones) while minimizing the extinguishing time; and 2) decision-makers prefer to complete this task given limited vehicle resources. To do so, this paper presents a novel multiobjective scheduling model to handle forest fires subject to limited rescue vehicle (fire engine) constraints, in which a fire-spread speed model is introduced into this problem to better describe practical forestry fire. Moreover, a Multiobjective Hybrid Differential- Evolution Particle-Swarm-Optimization (MHDP) algorithm is proposed to create a set of Pareto solutions for this problem. This approach is applied to a real-world emergency scheduling problem of the forest fire in Mt. Daxing'anling, China. Its effectiveness is verified by comparing it with a genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to quickly produce satisfactory Pareto solutions.

AB In decision-based design, the principal role of a designer is to make decisions. Decision support is crucial to augment this role. In this paper, we present an ontology that provides decision support from both the "construct" and the "information" perspectives that address the gap that existing research focus on these two perspectives separately and cannot provide effective decision support. The decision support construct in the ontology is the compromise decision support problem (cDSP) that is used to make multiobjective design decisions. The information for decision making is archived as cDSP templates and represented using frame-based ontology for facilitating reuse, consistency maintaining, and rapid execution. In order to facilitate designers' effective reuse of the populated cDSP templates ontology instances, we identified three types of modification that can be made when design consideration evolves. In our earlier work, part of the utilization (consistency checking) of the ontology has been demonstrated through a thin-walled pressure vessel redesign example. In this paper, we comprehensively present the ontology utilization including consistency checking, trade-off analysis, and design space visualization based on the pressure vessel example.

AB The problem of improving the energy behaviour of existing buildings is a current topic of interest in scientific research. In recent years, Public Administrations have made an effort to introduce norms that help to reorient the tendency toward increasing energy consumption by buildings. To do so, manufacturers have developed numerous energy efficiency measures that have become widely extended. The main problem when selecting one or various measures is to identify the ones that will provide the best trade-off between services and implementation costs. This paper presents a study focused on implementing techniques for calculating the heating and cooling energy demand, along with genetic algorithm, to optimize the process of adjusting the building's energy efficiency rating to a determined rating for existing building. The proposed optimization approach is applied to a real case to demonstrate its validity in a real-world situation. Practical application: This paper presents an innovative method for the building energy retrofit process. By applying a simple genetic algorithm, the aim is to optimize the cost of intervening in an existing building by fixing the energy rating obtained at a given value. The practical potential of the method presented here is quite extensive, with its greatest exponent being its use by technicians who are unfamiliar with optimization processes. The application of this calculation methodology would simplify the study of projects in the phase of selecting energy-saving measures, given that there are currently many of them, with their independent characteristics, which makes the selection process a slow and ineffective task. In addition, the method's intuitive interface and the fact that it is programmed in MS Excel make it an innovative method with great applicability in the field of building process optimization.

AB Building energy efficient design optimization is an emerging technique that is increasingly being used to design buildings with better overall performance and a particular emphasis on energy efficiency. To achieve building energy efficient design optimization, algorithms are vital to generate new designs and' thus drive the design optimization process. Therefore, the performance of algorithms is crucial to achieving effective energy efficient design techniques. This study evaluates algorithms used for building energy efficient design optimization. A set of performance indices, namely, stability, robustness, validity, speed, coverage, and locality, is proposed to evaluate the overall performance of algorithms. A benchmark building and a design optimization problem are also developed. Hooke-Jeeves algorithm, Multi Objective Genetic Algorithm II, and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm are evaluated by using the proposed performance indices and benchmark design,problem. Results indicate that no algorithm performs best in all six areas. Therefore, when facing an energy efficient design problem, the algorithm must be carefully selected based on the nature of the problem and the performance indices that matter the most.

AB Exergy and exergoeconomics assessment tools were applied to a municipal solid waste (MSW) gasification system integrated with a combined cycle (WICC). The techno-economic feasibility of the system was studied using a typical MSW produced in southern Chile and a combined experimental-modeling approach. Results suggested that gasifier should operate between 850 degrees C and 950 degrees C, in order to produce a syngas with the required energy content (LHV>3 MJ/kg) to feed power and steam cycles. Operation at lower temperatures and equivalence ratios, reduced the exergy efficiencies (<49%) due to, the low carbon conversion, syngas composition and to the low heat recovery potential of exhausted gas. Exergy losses at gasifier amounted nearly 60% of the whole system due to the effect of chemical reactions and heat transfer in this stage. Above 850 degrees C, the total production cost (C-tot), exergy destruction cost (C-D) and environmental cost (C-env) were reduced, leading to a positive economic framework. The thermoeconomic cost of electricity (TCOE) using MSW as feedstock varied between 0.07 and 0.13 US$ kWh(-1), which is competitive with the electricity price in the Chilean market (0.12 US$ kWh(-1)).

AB Utility supply networks and hydrogen (H-2) supply networks have been consistently individually studied in terms of techno-economic feasibility of large scale..A number of studies have proposed and improved mathematical models for design of each optimized supply network. However, although two different networks can coexist in a large-scale industrial complex, few studies have been conducted to develop an integrated utility supply and H-2 supply network (IUHSN) design in a techno-economic optimization framework. In this study, we design an IUHSN which includes a number of utilities (steam, water, and electricity), and H-2 sources (manufacturers) and sinks (end customers), Steam methane reforming (SMR) process is used as an intermediate linkage between both networks. To obtain an optimal design of the IUHSN reflecting the reality, we develop a mathematical model which is formulated as multi-period stochastic mixed integer linear programming concerning uncertain raw material prices. This model allows identification of a promising design strategy to minimize total supply cost, because sources and sinks can be connected to each other to transfer unused resources and products.

AB The sustainability of chemical processes depends on three major pillars, namely, economic performance, environmental and social impacts. To design sustainable processes based on renewable sources and/or to compare fuels and technologies in view of their sustainability, a simple 3-D metric has been developed. It involves production and investment costs, the effect of the facility on the generation of jobs, the emissions of carbon dioxide, due to the consumption of energy and water, and their mitigation, due to the production of renewable based commodities and chemicals. The carbon tax is used to normalize the contribution of the use of resources and the substitution of products by the renewable counterparts into an economic basis. The metric is region specific. It can be used as objective function in process synthesis or as an offline tool for sustainability assessment. In this paper, a large number of biofuels, including several processing paths, and processes for the production of chemicals or power from solar and wind have been evaluated using the metric. The results show that the processes that generate a surplus of energy, like FT fuels, are more sustainable because of their emission mitigation potential. Furthermore; water availability determines the sustainability of solar based facilities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Because of the non-linear and non-explicit relationships between system parameters and incomplete and/or complicated mathematical model, iterative approaches that work based on the experts' knowledge to optimize or improve complex energy systems. Main focus on this study was to encode the iterative approach in the form of a fuzzy inference system, FIS, to maximize profit of a power plant through controlling the effective operating parameters, while the load of a power plant is changed. As a benchmark power station, a 250 MW unit in the Shahid-Rajaei steam power was considered for optimization. The profits of the power plant at various loads were estimated using exergoeconomic analysis; then, it was optimized through optimal regulating the flow rates of extracted steam from the high and low pressure turbines in an iterative, procedure. The FIS worked based on the magnitude of the cost of exergy destruction of feed-water heaters. The faster computation time of the FIS compared to the GA, make it as a suitable option for the real-time optimization in form of fuzzy controllers. Using the developed FIS, the profit of the power plant at 100, 80, and 60% of the nominal power was increased 153.0, 322.0, and 280.0 $ h(-1), respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A blank dimension is not only a premise of blank design and manufacture, but also plays a significant role to decide the machining process and the energy consumption of the machining process. The design of an appropriate blank dimension is important to ensure efficient energy usage. However, consideration of a workpiece machining process and energy consumption during the machining process in the blank dimension design phase is often neglected. To design a blank dimension scientifically and effectively, this paper proposes an optimization approach for blank dimension design, by considering energy consumption, machine cost, and process time. The three objectives are affected by three variables, cutting depth, feed rate, and cutting speed. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) algorithm was used to solve multi-objective optimization problem, and blank dimensions could be calculated from the cutting depth of minimum energy consumption and workpiece dimension. The results indicated that the proposed approach is effective in realizing energy savings due to the appropriate blank dimension design. The optimization approach not only offers some insights for designing a new blank dimension, but also provides a theoretical basis for existing blank dimension selection.

AB In this paper the integration of Distributed Generation (DG) in radial distribution system is investigated by computing the optimal site and size of DG to be placed. An analytical expression based on equivalent current injection has been derived by utilizing topological structure of radial distribution system to find optimal size of DG to minimize losses. In the presented formulation, the optimal DG placement is obtained without repeatedly computing the load flow. The proposed formulation can be used to find the optimal size of all types of DGs namely Type-I, Type-II, Type-III and Type-IV DGs. The investigations are carried out on IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus radial distribution systems. The optimal DG placement results into reduction in active and reactive power losses and improvement in voltage profile of the buses.

AB We consider one applied global optimization problem where a set of feasible solutions is discrete and very large. The goal is to find optimal perfect gratings, which can guarantee high quality and security of the visual cryptography method. A priori estimation techniques, such as branch and bound type methods, cannot be applied to exclude an essential part of elements from the feasible set. Thus, a full search is required to solve this global optimization problem exactly, which is very computationally demanding. A library of C++ templates is developed that allows its user to implement parallel master-slave algorithms for his/her application without any knowledge of parallel programming API (application programming interface). Design of the templates allows users to build a parallel solver using MPI (message passing interface) API or distributed computing application using BOINC (Berkeley open infrastructure for network computing) API from the same C/C++ code with implementation of application-specific tasks. We build parallel and distributed computing solvers for the considered optimization problem and present results of computational experiments using a computer cluster and BOINC project for volunteer computing. Heuristic methods are also considered as an alternative to the full search algorithm. Due to complicated conditions defining feasible solutions (perfect gratings), genetic algorithms cannot be used to solve this problem efficiently. We propose two memetic heuristic algorithms, when a basic stochastic or simplified full search algorithm is combined with a local search algorithm. Parallel heuristic algorithms are also proposed and implemented. The efficiency and accuracy of heuristics are investigated and results of experiments are presented.

AB A strip laminar cooling process is investigated in this paper. Entransy theory and generalized constructal optimization are introduced into the optimization. Total water flow amount (WFA) in the laminar cooling zone (LCZ) and complex function are taken as the constraint and optimization objective, respectively. The entransy dissipation (ED) and maximum temperature different (MTD) of the strip are simultaneously considered in the complex function. WFA distributions of the headers in the LCZ are optimized. The effects of the total WFA, strip thickness and cooling water temperature on the optimal results are analyzed. The optimal cooling scheme is the eleventh cooling mode for the considered total 257 cooling schemes, and the complex function, ED and MTD of the strip are decreased by 11.59%, 5.59% and 17.58% compared with the initial cooling scheme, respectively. The total WFA and strip thickness have the obvious influences on the optimal cooing scheme, but the cooling water temperature has no influence in the parameter analysis range of this paper. The "generalized optimal construct" derived by minimum complex function shows a compromise between the energy retention and quality of the strip.

AB A two-stage dual-objective structural identification method is presented in this article. The complexity of the identification of story-level physical models for large-scale building structures is first addressed through a comparative study. A stiffness variation-based stabilizing objective is proposed to be necessarily incorporated into iterative optimization with the classical performance objectives to improve the model feasibility, and an area-type evaluation index is subsequently proposed for the stopping criteria. Accordingly, a two-stage differential evolution-based dual-objective optimization framework is presented for the computation of Pareto fronts for nondominated candidate solutions. Then, the proposed method is investigated using two illustrative examples, including a nine-story benchmark structure, and a real-world seven-story reinforced concrete structure. A series of condensed models are identified from the nondominated solutions on the Pareto front. The prediction performance of the single-objective optimal model and the dual-objective acceptable models is compared using the overall discrepancies of acceleration, interstory drift, and modal properties, within both estimation and validation cases. Incorporation of the noise effect into the method is finally studied and discussed.

AB Supply reliability can be effectively improved by a normally closed-loop operation of a distribution network with dual sources, in which there might be large circulating power flow. A unified power flow controller (UPFC) has the powerful capability to adjust the power flow, but it would face a technoeconomic bottleneck when applied to the distribution system. Based on the constant current load model, the power flow distribution of a normally closed-loop distribution network with dual sources is analyzed, and the relationship between the network loss, the voltage deviation of load nodes, and the compensated voltage is deduced. Then, the optimal power flow control model is presented considering such economic factors as the network loss, the voltage deviation of load nodes, and the cost of the apparatus used to produce the compensated voltage. In order to simplify the problem of multiobjective optimization into a single-objective optimization model, the fuzzy membership functions and their weight coefficients of the network loss, the voltage deviation, and the UPFC's cost are designed, and the weights are determined according to their contribution in economy. The optimal control model is solved with the global optimal algorithm. Simulation results based on PSCAD prove that this method can ensure overall economy of the system with balancing the power distribution, controlling the node voltage deviation, and decreasing the active power loss of the network effectively.

AB Multidisciplinary global shape optimization requires a geometric parameterization method that keeps the shape generality while lowering the number of free variables. This paper presents a reduced parameter set parameterization method based on integral B-spline surface capable of both shape and topology variations and suitable for global multidisciplinary optimization. The objective of the paper is to illustrate the advantages of the proposed method in comparison to standard parameterization and to prove that the proposed method can be used in an integrated multidisciplinary workflow. Non-linear fitting is used to test the proposed parameterization performance before the actual optimization. The parameterization method can in this way be tested and pre-selected based on previously existing geometries. Fitting tests were conducted on three shapes with dissimilar geometrical features, and great improvement in shape generality while reducing the number of shape parameters was achieved. The best results are obtained for a small number (up to 50) of optimization variables, where a classical applying of parameterization method requires about two times as many optimization variables to obtain the same fitting capacity.
   The proposed shape parameterization method was tested in a multidisciplinary ship hull optimization workflow to confirm that it can actually be used in multiobjective optimization problems. The workflow integrates shape parameterization with hydrodynamic, structural and geometry analysis tools. In comparison to classical local and global optimization methods, the evolutionary algorithm allows for fully autonomous design with an ability to generate a wide Pareto front without a need for an initial solution.

AB Based on a nonlinear mathematical programming model, the sizes and operating conditions of the process units of single-effect absorption refrigeration systems operating with a LiBr-H2O solution are optimized for a specified cooling capacity by minimizing three single objective functions: the total exergy loss rate, the total heat transfer area, and the total annual cost of the system.
   It was found that the optimal solution obtained by minimization of the total exergy loss rate provides "theoretical" upper bounds not only for the total heat transfer area of the system but also for each process unit and all stream temperatures, while the optimal solution obtained by minimization of the total heat transfer area provides the lower bounds for these model variables, to solve a cost optimization problem.
   The minimization of the total exergy loss rate by varying parametrically the available total heat transfer area between these bounds was also performed, allowing to see how the optimal distribution of the available total heat transfer area among the system components, as well as the operating conditions (stream temperature, pressure, composition, and mass flow rate) and heat loads, vary qualitatively and quantitatively with increasing available total heat transfer area. These optimization results allowed to find a "practical" value of the total heat transfer area, i.e. no benefits can be obtained by increasing the available total heat transfer area above this value since the minimal total exergy loss value cannot be significantly improved by distributing additional heat transfer area among the process units. The optimal solution corresponding to this practical value significantly improves the upper bounds for an economic optimization problem with respect to the optimal solution corresponding to the theoretical value.
   The optimal solutions corresponding to the theoretical and the practical upper bound values for the total heat transfer area (100 m(2) and 61 m(2), respectively) as well as the optimal solution obtained by minimization of the total annual cost are discussed for a case study considering a cooling capacity of 50 kW, upon the model assumptions made and a given cost model. Around three-quarters of the minimal total annual cost correspond to capital expenditures and the rest to operating expenditures. The generator and evaporator represent together around 70% of the capital expenditures. The absorber is the largest contributor to both the total heat transfer area and the total exergy loss rate, with around 33.19 and 39.16%, respectively, when the total annual cost is minimized.

AB Disassembly modeling and planning are meaningful and important to the reuse, recovery, and recycling of obsolete and discarded products. However, the existing methods pay little or no attention to resources constraints, e.g., disassembly operators and tools. Thus a resulting plan when being executed may be ineffective in actual product disassembly. This paper proposes to model and optimize selective disassembly sequences subject to multiresource constraints to maximize disassembly profit. Moreover, two scatter search algorithms with different combination operators, namely one with precedence preserved crossover combination operator and another with path-relink combination operator, are designed to solve the proposed model. Their validity is shown by comparing them with the optimization results from well-known optimization software CPLEX for different cases. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Carbon dioxide removal assembly (CDRA) is an essential subsystem in an air revitalization system (ARS) to control CO2 concentration in a long-term manned spacecraft cabin. At the same time, it is a main power consumption subsystem. CO2 concentration control performance and power consumption are both key factors that need to be considered. To design this subsystem reasonably, some basic processes are analyzed carefully in this paper, such as mass and heat transfer processes in CO2 adsorption beds, power consumption for fan and electric heater, and entropy generation in heat transfer process. The relationship between CDRA and other subsystems are also analyzed carefully. Based on these analyses, a multiobjective optimal method is developed in this paper. Its objective functions are specified as cabin CO2 concentration level, power consumption, and entropy generation. The optimal parameters are air velocity, absorption bed length, adsorption time (half cycle time), and molecular sieve mass loaded in the absorption bed. An improved genetic algorithm, Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II), is adopted to obtain the final optimal solution set. Furthermore, a CDRA for a space station with three astronauts is taken as an example to show the implementation of the proposed method. Optimal results show that the presented optimal method can obtain the design solution set for the CDRA. The optimal parameter combination is recommended as the final optimal design solution by analyzing the global pareto optimal front of the solution set. This multiobjective optimal method can realize an optimization process for a complex system design by taking a comprehensive consideration of various factors and running performances.

AB Following disasters, emergency management agencies are under immense pressure to make quick decisions regarding the provision of temporary housing, including their locations and types. Such decisions can significantly impact the socioeconomic recovery of displaced families and available budgets for other postdisaster activities. To address these challenges, a new holistic temporary housing planning framework is proposed to offer customized housing plans tailored to the specific social, economic, and psychological needs of displaced families while controlling expenditures. This paper presents the theoretical formulation and implementation details of the community-based housing response pool, which is a comprehensive framework that aims at (1)quantifying the specific needs and preferences of each displaced family, (2)evaluating the ability of housing alternatives to meet those needs, (3)computing temporary housing life cycle costs, and (4)optimizing housing decisions accordingly. The paper also presents an application example to demonstrate and evaluate the optimization model capabilities.

AB Virtual experiments have been designed for the development and validation of coupled surface-subsurface modeling. Potentially, virtual experiments can guide model calibration as well. To address the role of virtual experiments in model calibration, a novel approach was described for a real watershed calibration of Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM) guided by the V-shaped catchment simulation. First, a benchmarking experiment of coupled surface-subsurface modeling was developed and documented on the V-shaped catchment. Then, the performance of hydrologic predictions for the V-shaped catchment was calculated and demonstrated different levels of correlations. The correlations were found stable, which had the potential to be used as the weights of multiobjective calibration. Therefore, a weighted multiobjective calibration was developed for a real-world watershed by transferring the correlations obtained from the virtual experiments. Expectedly, the parameters calibrated using the weighted approach indicated improvement of the model performance in simulating water-table depths and evapotranspiration with little sacrifice of model performance in streamflow. In addition, this study also compares the weighted average calibration and unweighted calibration. The results demonstrate the weighted objective optimization achieved satisfactory compromise for each calibration objective. Overall, the virtual experiment is proved to be an efficient tool to facilitate calibration of complex models. The proposed weighted objective approach provides an effective calibration strategy for the multiple observation constraints, which can be applied for the calibration of coupled environmental process models with multiple observations.

The Fritz John-type necessary optimality conditions and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-type necessary optimality conditions for a weak Pareto solution are derived for such a nonsmooth vector optimization problem. Further, the concept of an F-convex function with respect to a convex compact set is introduced. Then, the sufficient optimality conditions for a (weak) Pareto optimality of a feasible solution are established for the considered nonsmooth multiobjective optimization problem under assumptions that the involved functions are quasidifferentiable F-convex with respect to convex compact sets which are equal to Minkowski sum of their subdifferentials and superdifferentials at this point.

AB This study determines the optimal operational strategies for a complex water resource system. These strategies are derived from four conflicting objective functions: maximization of net irrigation benefits, maximization of employment generation, minimization of cultivation cost, and maximization of revenue generation from industrial and municipal supplies. Multiobjective fuzzy linear programming (MOFLP) models, i.e.,the maximum-minimum (max-min) operator, two-phase MOFLP (TPMOFLP), and fuzzy compromise approach (average operator), are derived from the individual linear programming solutions of these objective functions. The performances of the derived MOFLP models are compared for inflows that have different probabilities of exceedance with reference to the overall degree of satisfaction, irrigation intensity, and optimized values of the relevant objective functions. The cropping pattern obtained from the recommended MOFLP model, i.e.,average operator Case-I (overall degree of satisfaction =0.75), is compared with the actual cropping pattern in the command area in recent years to highlight the need for the developed model. The irrigation intensity for the whole command area from the recommended MOFLP model (104.6%) has been found to be significantly higher than the actual cropping patterns adopted in recent years. The net irrigation benefits, employment generation, cost of cultivation, and municipal and industrial revenue obtained from the recommended MOFLP model are Rs 11,058.27million, 33,414.62 thousand work days, Rs 5,622.20 million, and Rs 2,686.25 million, respectively. Additionally, the performance of the water resource system using the recommended model is simulated based on 36years of historical data and 100 years of synthetically generated data and is measured in terms of the performance indices reported by previous studies. The analyses show that the irrigation deficit will increase from 11.22x106m3 for the past 36years to 26.67x106m3 over the next 100 years. The monthly (MFID) and annual frequency irrigation deficits (AFID) will rise from 7.17% (past) to 13.92% (in next 100years) and from 52.77% (past) to 82% (in next 100years), respectively.

AB Binder systems can meet various requirements that include excellent fluidity of injection, good strength of a green body, and rapid thermal debinding. This, however, can be a complex process, and novel binders for practical use in nano powder injection molding (NPIM) as well as in powder injection molding (mu PIM) can be hidden in a multi-compositional search space that contains an almost infinite number of combinations of well-known waxes, polymers, and surfactants. To establish novel binder materials systematically from a carefully chosen, 7-dimensional search space of (Carnauba wax (CW) - Emulsifying wax (EW) - Paraffin wax (PW)) - (Polyethylene glycol 20,000 (PEG20000) - Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) - Polypropylene (PP)) - (Stearic acid (SA)) a metaheuristics optimization strategy, such as the elitism-involved non-dominated-sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), was coupled with a virtual combinatorial materials search (VCMS) involving the hybrid evaluation of multi-objective functions on the basis of a semi-theoretical and semi-empirical approach. Although the process started with random compositions, it eventually converged into a series of new quaternary compositions including EW, PW, PEG20000, and SA that show strong potential for practical applications to NPIM and mu PIM.

AB A multiperiod stochastic mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to address the tactical capacity planning of semiconductor manufacturing with considerations of complex routing of material flows, in-process inventory, demand and capacity variability, multisite production, capacity utilization rate, and downside risk management. Both planning level decisions (i.e., capacity allocation and customer service level decisions) as well as operational level decisions (i.e., production, inventory, and shipment decisions) can be simultaneously determined based on the two proposed multiobjective optimization models. To address the huge number of scenarios needed to characterize the uncertainty and the large number of first-stage integer variables in industrial scale applications, two novel scalable distributed parallel optimization algorithms are developed to mitigate the computational burden. The proposed mathematical models and algorithms are illustrated through two case studies from a major US semiconductor manufacturer. Results from these case studies provide key decision support for capacity expansion in semiconductor industry. (c) 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 62: 3930-3946, 2016

AB With the geosynchronous synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite as the transmitter, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can passively receive the echo within the illuminated ground area and achieve 2-D imaging of the interested target. This SAR system, known as GEO-UAV bistatic SAR, is capable of autonomously accomplishing the bistatic SAR mission in rough terrain environments by prespecifying a path for the UAV receiver. In this paper, the GEO-UAV bistatic SAR system is first investigated. The practical advantages and spatial resolution are then analyzed in detail. The spatial resolution of GEO-UAV bistatic SAR is dependent on the observation geometry, which is determined by the UAV path. Therefore, the path planning for GEO-UAV bistatic SAR aims at identifying a set of optimal paths for the UAV receiver to travel through a 3-D terrain environment that simultaneously guarantees the safety of the UAV and achieves SAR imaging with optimized performance during the flight. The path planning is modeled as a constrained multiobjective optimization problem (MOP), which accurately represents the two main aspects for the path planning problem, i.e., UAV navigation and bistatic SAR imaging. Then, a path planning method based on a constrained-adaptive-multiobjective-differential-evolution algorithm is proposed to solve the MOP and generate multiple feasible paths for the UAV receiver with different tradeoffs between navigation for UAV and bistatic SAR imaging performance. The GEO-UAV bistatic SAR mission designer can choose a path from the solution set according to the application requirements, which makes the method more pragmatic.

AB Electric impact wrench is an important tool used in manufacturing and maintenance services. It has complex mechanism and its operation involves dynamic events occurring at vastly different time scales, which poses challenges for efficient and accurate modeling to facilitate design optimization and control. This investigation establishes a first principle-based, system-level model of a representative impact wrench. The model explicitly incorporates the dynamic flexibility of gear transmission, spindle shaft, and impacting components into the kinematic relations that connect them together. The nonlinear impact and contact events, coupled with the rotational and translational motions of all components, are explicitly analyzed, and systematic parametric identification is performed based on a multi-objective optimization (MOO) approach. The model prediction is correlated with experimental studies.

AB In this article the most fundamental decomposition-based optimization method - block coordinate search, based on the sequential decomposition of problems in subproblems - and building performance simulation programs are used for reasoning about a building design, process at micro-urban scale and defining strategies for making the search more efficient. Cyclic overlapping block coordinate search is here considered in its double nature of optimization method and surrogate model (and metaphor) of a sequential design process. Heuristic indicators apt to support the design of search structures suited to that method are then developed from building-simulation-assisted computational experiments aimed to choose the form and position of a small building in a plot. Those indicators link the sharing of structure between subproblems ("commonality") to recursive recombination, measured as freshness of the search wake and novelty of the search moves, and can be of assistance in devising search structures suitable for being search efficiently. This is because they bring some memory of the search history to algorithms which otherwise would have not one. The aim of these indicators is to measure the relative effectiveness of alternatives for recursively decomposing problems so as to make searches more efficient than randomly structured ones. Implications of a possible use of these indicators in genetic algorithms are also highlighted. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the design, analysis, manufacturing, experimental testing, and multiobjective optimization of a new family of ultra-efficient composite truss structures. The continuously wound truss concept introduced here is a versatile, low cost and scalable method of manufacturing truss structures based on a simple winding process. A prototype truss configuration is shown and experimentally characterized under torsion and three point bending loads. A large deformation implementation of the direct stiffness method is shown to provide good prediction of the stiffness properties of the prototype truss. This model is extended to include strength prediction with multiple failure modes. The design space achievable with these truss structures is then explored through multiobjective optimization using the NSGA II genetic algorithm. These continuously wound truss structures have the potential to provide between one and two orders of magnitude increase in structural efficiency compared to existing carbon fiber composite tubes.

AB Robust parameter and tolerance design are effective methods to improve process quality. It is reported in the literature that the traditional two-stage approach that performs parameter design followed by tolerance design to reduce the sensitivity to variations of input characteristics is suboptimal. To mitigate the problem, an integrated parameter and tolerance design (IPTD) methodology that is suitable for linear models is suggested. In this article, a computer-aided IPTD approach for computer experiments is proposed, in which the means and tolerances of input characteristics are simultaneously optimized to minimize the total cost. A Gaussian process metamodel is used to emulate the response function to reduce the number of simulations. A closed-form expression for the posterior expected quality loss is derived to facilitate optimization in computer-aided IPTD. As there is often uncertainty about the true quality and tolerance costs, multiobjective optimization with quality loss and tolerance cost as objective functions is proposed to find robust optimal solutions.

AB Energy efficiency is a mandatory requirement and integral part of green and sustainable buildings. Energy efficient design optimization is both a design philosophy and a practical technique that has been proposed and used by architects and other professionals for several decades, especially in the past few years. In this review, a set of selection criteria are proposed and 116 works are identified as the core literature. Taking the perspective of architects, analysis is conducted to the core literature to reveal the state of the art of building energy efficient design optimization. The analyzed subjects include the general procedure, the origin and development, the classification, the design objectives and variables, the energy simulation engines, the optimization algorithms, and the applications. The review findings confirm that building energy efficient design optimization is a promising technique to design buildings with higher energy efficiency and better overall performance. However, obstacles still exist and future research is needed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This article hybridises a Green Data Envelopment Analysis (GDEA)-based approach with a new Genetic/Immune Strategy for Data Envelopment Analysis (GIS-DEA). A GIS-DEA approach provides a different view to solving multi-criteria decision making problems using data envelopment analysis (DEA) by considering DEA as a multi-objective optimisation problem with efficiency as one objective and proximity of solution to decision makers' preferences as the other objective. The hybrid approach called GIS-GDEA is applied here to a well-known automobile spare parts manufacturer in India and the results presented. User validation developed based on specific set of criteria suggests that the supplier selection process with GIS-GDEA is more practical than other approaches in a current industrial scenario with multiple decision makers.

AB Choosing the optimum cutting parameters is regarded as one of the important energy saving technologies. This paper presents a method for complex optimization of cutting parameters with the objectives of energy efficiency and processing time, which integrates Taguchi method, response surface method (RSM) and multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOPSO). In this study, specific energy consumption (SEC) is selected to evaluate energy efficiency and the calculation model is introduced firstly. Then the method is described in detail. Taguchi is used to design the experiment, signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio is subsequently employed to analyze the performance of parameters on SEC and processing time, and the significant contributions of parameters can be determined by use of range analysis method. RSM is conducted to develop regression models for the responses based on the experimental data, and the optimal machining parameters for minimizing energy and time are determined through the modified MOPSO algorithm. Finally, four machining parameters schemes with different optimization objectives are compared, and the results show that a trade-off point can be drawn between the low processing time and high energy efficiency.

AB The eco-design of industrial processes is confronted with several key requirements: the proper definition and combination of Process Modelling and Life Cycle Assessment (PM-LCA methodology), the complete integration of alternative raw materials and renewable energy resources and their life cycle networks, and the efficient multi-objective optimization of the whole process including the supply chain. In order to respond to these requirements, this work extends the structure of the PM-LCA framework by also involving the life cycle networks of various energy resources and raw materials. In addition, and due to the computational complexity of such a combined platform, an appropriate multi-objective optimization strategy, dubbed AMOEA-MAP and dedicated to expensive black-box problems, is used to attain the Pareto-optimal solutions for design with a fixed computation budget of 200 function evaluations for a bi-objective problem (cost - environmental impacts).
   The successful application of such a methodology is then demonstrated for a conventional drinking water production plant, by optimizing a set of mixed-integer decision variables comprising both real type operating conditions and integer-type design parameters related to the choice of relevant raw materials and renewable energy resources (heat and electricity). The results also show an additional improvement by a factor of five in the overall economic and environmental performance of the optimized plant when alternative renewable energy resources are included.

   STRATEGY
AB The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and detection error tradeoff (DET) curves are frequently used in the machine learning community to analyze the performance of binary classifiers. Recently, the convex-hull-based multiobjective genetic programming algorithm was proposed and successfully applied to maximize the convex hull area for binary classification problems by minimizing false positive rate and maximizing true positive rate at the same time using indicator-based evolutionary algorithms. The area under the ROC curve was used for the performance assessment and to guide the search. Here we extend this research and propose two major advancements: Firstly we formulate the algorithm in detection error tradeoff space, minimizing false positives and false negatives, with the advantage that misclassification cost tradeoff can be assessed directly. Secondly, we add complexity as an objective function, which gives rise to a 3D objective space (as opposed to a 2D previous ROC space). A domain specific performance indicator for 3D Pareto front approximations, the volume above DET surface, is introduced, and used to guide the indicator -based evolutionary algorithm to find optimal approximation sets. We assess the performance of the new algorithm on designed theoretical problems with different geometries of Pareto fronts and DET surfaces, and two application-oriented benchmarks: (1) Designing spam filters with low numbers of false rejects, false accepts, and low computational cost using rule ensembles, and (2) finding sparse neural networks for binary classification of test data from the UCI machine learning benchmark. The results show a high performance of the new algorithm as compared to conventional methods for multicriteria optimization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents two-stage bi-objective stochastic programming models for disaster relief operations. We consider a problem that occurs in the aftermath of a natural disaster: a transportation system for supplying disaster victims with relief goods must be established. We propose bi-objective optimization models with a monetary objective and humanitarian objective. Uncertainty in the accessibility of the road network is modeled by a discrete set of scenarios. The key features of our model are the determination of locations for intermediate depots and acquisition of vehicles. Several model variants are considered. First, the operating budget can be fixed at the first stage for all possible scenarios or determined for each scenario at the second stage. Second, the assignment of vehicles to a depot can be either fixed or free. Third, we compare a heterogeneous vehicle fleet to a homogeneous fleet. We study the impact of the variants on the solutions. The set of Pareto-optimal solutions is computed by applying the adaptive Epsilon-constraint method. We solve the deterministic equivalents of the two-stage stochastic programs using the MIP-solver CPLEX.

AB In this paper, the topic of constrained multiobjective in-core fuel management optimisation (MICFMO) using metaheuristics is considered. Several modern and state-of-the-art metaheuristics from different classes, including evolutionary algorithms, local search algorithms, swarm intelligence algorithms, a probabilistic model-based algorithm and a harmony search algorithm, are compared in order to determine which approach is the most suitable in the context of constrained MICFMO. A test suite of 16 optimisation problem instances, based on the SAFARI-1 nuclear research reactor, has been established for the comparative study. The suite is partitioned into three classes, each consisting of problem instances having a different number of objectives, but subject to the same stringent constraint set. The effectiveness of a multiplicative penalty function constraint handling technique is also compared with the constrained-domination technique from the literature. The different optimisation approaches are compared in a nonparametric statistical analysis. The analysis reveals that multiplicative penalty function constraint handling is a competitive alternative to constrained-domination, and seems to be particularly effective in the context of bi-objective optimisation problems. In terms of the metaheuristic solution comparison, it is found that the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), the Pareto ant colony optimisation (P-ACO) algorithm and the multiobjective optimisation using cross-entropy method (MOOCEM) are generally the best-performing metaheuristics across all three problem classes, along with the multiobjective variable neighbourhood search (MOVNS) in the bi-objective problem class. Furthermore, the practical relevance of the metaheuristic results is demonstrated by comparing the solutions thus obtained to the current SAFARI-1 reload configuration design approach.

AB This paper proposes an opposition-based greedy heuristic search (OGHS) strategy to solve multi objective thermal power dispatch problem as a non-linear constrained optimization problem considering operating cost and pollutant emissions as competing objectives. The optimization problem is solved to find global solution, in case any one objective function is non-convex and non-differentiable. To generate initial population opposition-based learning is applied to select good candidates by exploring the search space extensively. Further, opposition-based learning is exploited for migration to maintain the diversity in the set of feasible solutions. Proposed method applies mutation strategy by perturbing the genes heuristically and seeking better one. This concept introduces parallelism and makes the algorithm always greedy for better solution. The greediness and randomness pulls the algorithm towards the global solution. The algorithm is also self sufficient without the need of tuning any parameter that effects acceleration of the algorithm. Fuzzy-theory is employed for decision-making that selects best solution from available non-inferior solutions. Feasible solution is also achieved heuristically that modifies the generation-schedule and avoids violation of operating generation limits. Proposed method has been implemented to analyze economic and multi-objective thermal power dispatch problems considering ramp-rate limits, prohibited-operating-zones, valve-point-loading effects, multiple-fuel options, environmental effects, and exact transmission losses encountered in realistic power system operation. The validity of proposed method is demonstrated on medium and large power systems. Proposed optimization technique is emerged out to compete with existing solution techniques. Wilcoxon signed-rank test for independent samples also proves the supremacy of proposed algorithm OGHS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we introduce twice weakly differentiable and twice H-differentiable interval valued functions. The existence of twice H-differentiable interval-valued function and its relation with twice weakly differentiable functions are presented. Interval valued bonvex and generalized bonvex functions involving twice H-differentiability are proposed. Under the proposed settings, necessary conditions are elicited naturally in order to achieve RI efficient solution. Mangasarian type dual is discussed for a nondifferentiable multiobjective programming problem and appropriate duality results are also derived. The theoretical developments are illustrated through non-trivial numerical examples.

AB Computing a similarity measure of a given set of molecular sequences is an important task in bioinformatics studies. Weighted sequences have become an interesting research area since they allow a newer and more precise encoding paradigm of molecular structures. The longest common subsequence (LCS) has been an extensively studied technique to compute similarity on sequences represented as strings and it has been used in many applications. There is a current trend to generalize those algorithms to work on weighted sequences too. The resulting variant of the problem is called the weighted LCS. In this paper, we study the problem of finding the weighted LCS of two weighted sequences. Particularly, a novel approach is presented to tackle the weighted LCS for a bounded molecular alphabet constrained by one or two a parameters. Based on the dominant-match-point paradigm, we model the problem using a multiobjective optimization approach. As a result, we propose a novel, efficient and exact algorithm that not only finds the weighted LCS but also the set of all possible solutions. We perform experimental analysis using simulated and real data to compare the performance of the proposed approach. The experiments show that the proposed algorithm has a good performance in small instances of both benchmarks. Furthermore, it can be used on a great number of bioinformatics applications where the computation of similarity between short sequence fragments is needed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB To study the robustness of ecosystems is crucial to promote the sustainable development of human society. This paper aims to analyze the robustness of ecosystems from an interesting viewpoint of the species loss of community. Unlike the existing definitions, we first introduce the notion of a community as a population of species belonging to the same trophic level. We then put forward a novel multiobjective optimization model which can be utilized to discover community structures from arbitrary unipartite networks. Because an ecosystem is commonly represented as a multipartite network, we further introduce a mechanism of competition among species whereby a multipartite network is transformed into a unipartite signed network without loss of species interaction information. Finally, we examine three strategies to test the robustness of an ecosystem. Our experiments indicate that ecosystems are robust to random species loss of community but fragile to target ones. We also investigate the relationships between the robustness of an ecosystem and that of its community composed network both to species loss. Our experiments indicate that the robustness analysis of a large-scale ecosystem to species loss may be akin to that of its community composed network which is usually small in size.

AB A systematic approach for optimal batch water network synthesis is presented in this work, where multiple wastewater regeneration modules with various candidate technologies are taken into account. The integration of different regeneration technologies could further increase water reuse opportunities in the batch plants, thereby significantly reducing freshwater consumption and wastewater generation. Specifically, the regeneration modules are divided into batch and semicontinuous operating modes, which have never been considered completely in previous studies. A modified state-space superstructure incorporating a water-using subsystem, a regeneration subsystem, and buffer tanks is adopted to capture all realistic potential configurations. Correspondingly, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model embedded with the scheduling of regeneration subsystem and buffer tanks is formulated to minimize the total annualized cost. In addition, a rule based solution procedure is developed to reduce the computation complexity and two illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

AB The main objective of this research is to study a transcritical CO2 cycle via geothermal resources to produce electrical energy. Heat sink of this cycle is Liquefied natural gas (LNG) to drop back pressure of the CO2 turbine greatly. It is presumed that the system works under steady state situations to establish the mathematical model of the transcritical CO2 geothermal power generation system. To evaluate the impacts of different main thermodynamic parameters in the performance of the system a parametric investigation is employed. Furthermore, to determine an optimum system performance from an economical and thermodynamic point of view, a multi-objective optimization jointed to NSGA-II algorithm is employed. To calculate the final solution three decision makers comprising TOPSIS, LINAMP and FUZZY were use. Moreover, sensitivity analysis and error examination were performed on the solutions gained from the decision makers. In conclusion, outputs achieved from this investigation were compared to the other related studies and this comparison reveals that the solutions gained in this study are satisfactory compared to the previous works.

AB The enormous demand for large wind turbine rotors has led to a need to develop high-performance and reliable wind turbine rotors. The flexibility of the huge blade was a challenge in creating a balanced design with regard to dynamic behavior, mass, and power output. To enhance the wind turbine rotor, a newly designed wind turbine system with a supporting rod and damper was proposed and investigated. A scaled blade was experimentally tested, with the results indicating an increase in both frequency and damping of the system. Through the use of a self-coded numerical model, the correlations between the design constraints and the dynamic behavior, tip displacement, and additional mass of the rotor were demonstrated. This showed that the novel rotor has some preferable characteristics in both static and dynamic aspects. In particular, this blade is stiffer and has a smaller tip displacement compared with a traditional cantilevered blade. These characteristics enabled the effective application of the novel rotor to a 5-MW wind turbine to achieve a 15.16% power output increase based on the blade element momentum theory with Prandtl correction, as well as 5.1% mass savings.

AB Electricity generation through the burning of fossil fuels is one of the main contributors to the climate change problem. The use of renewable energy sources is a promising strategy to help mitigate this problem. This paper considers two forms of renewable energy: solar and biomass (algae) for power generation. The paper also accounts for the thermal storage of solar energy. A multiobjective optimization formulation is developed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and cost in the electricity generation process. The model is based on a new superstructure that incorporates various design configurations and screens different thermal storage systems. A case study is presented to show the applicability of the proposed approach and how the economic and environmental objectives can lie reconciled.

AB The green building assessment emphasizes the indoor environment quality (IEQ) by looking into the indoor air quality, lighting quality, acoustics, ventilation and thermal comfort conditions, which can be enhanced by effective initiatives at the early design stage. Designers and engineers usually consider exploiting passive designs to achieve a sustainable goal in building projects. In such background, this paper presents a holistic passive design approach by incorporating a robust sensitivity analysis to an efficient multi-objective optimization process to assess a typical high-rise residential building in hot and humid regions like Hong Kong. EnergyPlus and jEPlus are adopted to conduct modelling experiments with an input parametric matrix generated by the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). All related indoor environment performance indices including the daylight, natural ventilation and thermal comfort are treated as optimization objectives and constraints to fulfil the local green building guidance. The non dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is coupled with jEPlus to obtain the Pareto frontier by thoroughly searching the problem space constructed with screened out significant input variables from the sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, different post-optimization analysis methods are applied to decide the final optimum solution, where the total unmet time decreased by 11.2% in contrast with the baseline case.

AB This paper represents a stochastic approach for long-term optimal resource expansion planning of a grid connected microgrid (MG) containing different technologies as intermittent renewable energy resources, energy storage systems and thermal resources. Maximizing profit and reliability, along with minimizing investment and operation costs, are major objectives which have been considered in this model. Also, the impacts of intermittency and uncertainty in renewable energy resources were investigated. The interval linear programming (ILP) was applied for modelling inherent stochastic nature of the renewable energy resources. ILP presents some superiority in modelling of uncertainties in MG planning. The problem was formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming. It has been demonstrated previously that the benders decomposition (BD) served as an effective tool for solving such problems. BD divides the original problem into a master (investment) problem and operation and reliability subproblems. In this paper a multiperiod MG planning is presented, considering life time, maximum penetration limit of each technology, interest rate, capital recovery factor and investment fund. Real-time energy exchange with the utility is covered, with a consideration of variable tariffs at different load blocks. The presented approach can help MG planners to adopt best decision under various uncertainty levels based on their budgetary policies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A heat exchanger network (HEN) is an important part in processing plants used to recover heat from process streams. A utility system supplies heating and cooling utilities and introduces additional hot and cold streams for the processes. The HEN and utility system (e.g., Rankine cycle-based cogeneration system) are closely interconnected primarily through steam, steam condensate leaving the turbines, and process surplus heat. The recovery of the sensible heat from the steam condensate and process surplus heat through an integration technique may contribute significantly to the reduction of the heating and cooling utility consumption in the heat exchanger network as well as in the primary energy consumption in the utility system. In this paper, a systematic methodology for the simultaneous synthesis and design of a utility system and HEN is proposed. The heat recovery from the steam condensate and boiler feedwater preheating are integrated into the HEN synthesis together with the design optimization of a Rankine cycle-based utility system. In addition to the simultaneous design of the utility and heat recovery systems, the optimization variables include the steam condensate target temperature, the steam level for process heating, the energy demand for the utility system, the returning temperature of the steam condensate, and the final temperature of the boiler feed water. The total site HEN is composed of several interlinked sub-HENs. A model for the new hot utility-process cold stream HEN is formulated together with the hot-cold process streams of the HEN. The linking constraints between sub-HENs and the utility system are formulated. Several case studies are elaborated to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed methodology. Compared with the former design methods without integrating steam condensate sensible heat and boiler feedwater preheating, meaningful economic benefits can be achieved by applying the proposed framework.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate the economic performance of the waste heat recovery (WHR) system for a marine diesel engine. Four waste heat sources, which are exhaust gas, cylinder cooling water, scavenge air cooling water and lubricating oil of a marine diesel engine, are first applied to drive the transcritical Rankine cycle (TRC). R1234yf, R1234ze, R134a, R152a, R236fa and R290 are employed in the system as working fluids. The effects of expander inlet pressure and temperature on net power output, thermal efficiency, total cost, mass flow rate, and available efficiency of the WHR system are analyzed. The levelized energy cost is used to evaluate the economic optimizations and their corresponding optimal parameters in the WHR system. The results show that the optimal levelized energy cost of R236fa is the most excellent and is lower than that of R1234ze, R134a, R152a, R1234yf or R290 by 5.07%, 6.25%, 7.42%, 9.77% or 12.11%, respectively. The payback period, fuel oil saving, and CO2 emission reduction are applied to assess the suitability of these working fluids. Furthermore, the economic optimization correlations in terms of dimensionless optimal pressures and temperature difference ratios are proposed for the system design of the optimal operating conditions.

AB The unit exergy costs of desalination and purification, which are two alternatives commonly used for water supply and treatment, have been characterized as a function of the energy efficiency of the process by combining the Exergy Cost Analysis with Transfer Function Analysis. An equation to assess the exergy costs of these alternatives is then proposed as a quick guide to know the energy efficiency of any water treatment process under different design and operating conditions. This combination, was satisfactory applied to groundwaters and water transfers. After identifying the boundaries of the system, input and output flows are calculated in exergy values. Next, different examples are analyzed in order to propose a generic equation to assess the exergy cost of the water restoration technologies, attending to their main features. Recovery ratio, energy requirements and salts concentrations (for desalination), and plant capacity and organic matter recovery (for water purification) are introduced in the calculations as their main endogenous parameters. Values obtained for typical operation ranges of commercial plants showed that unit exergy costs of water purification ranged from 3.3 to 6.8; maximum values, as expected, were found at low plant capacities and high organic matter removal ratios. For water desalination, values varied from 2 to 7 in membrane technologies and from 10 to 26 in thermal processes. The recovery ratio and salts concentration in raw water increased the unit exergy costs in membrane techniques. In distillation processes, the unit exergy cost increased as the quality of the heat supplied did, but they are not so sensible to seawater salinity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While bioethanol has become a promising candidate for replacing fossil based transportation fuels, its economic feasibility still eludes industry investors. In particular, uncertainties exist in both production processes and associated markets. Hence, it is critical to develop process technology and strategize the operation and hedging decisions that improve financial viability. This paper considers long-term production scheduling under the impact of carbon tax constraints and ethanol spot price uncertainty, as well as risk management via ethanol swap contracts. More specifically, a framework consisting of a two-stage stochastic program and a two-factor time series model is presented to determine the weekly production rate and swap portfolios to maximize the process profit under spot price uncertainty.

AB The integration of a hybrid solid oxide fuel cell - gas turbine (SOFC-GT) system and reverse osmosis (RO) plant is evaluated thermodynamically and economically to enhance power generation and desalinate seawater on-site in a coastal energy-intensive industrial facility in the Persian (Arabian) Gulf. The power and fresh water co-generation scheme is based on the conversion of SOFC-GT exhaust thermal power into electrical work by a bottoming organic Rankine cycle (ORC) to drive the desalination high pressure pump. Seven ORC fluids are evaluated in terms of energetic and exergetic performance, as well as system size indicators. Depending upon the organic fluid selected, the net electrical power output generated from the exhaust of a 25 MWe hybrid SOFC-GT plant ranges from 1.2 to 2.4 MWe at an overall exhaust gas heat recovery efficiency of approximately 8-16% for R245fa and toluene, respectively. Compared with an existing standard GT cycle, the integrated SOFC-GT-toluene ORC-RO system enhances exergy efficiency by approximately 29%, while producing 494 m(3)/h of fresh water. The avoided purchase of fresh water, natural gas, and environmental emissions could generate net annual operating cost savings of 8-21 million USD based on subsidized and unsubsidized gas and water prices, respectively, and would become profitable within three to five years.

We generate an integrated renewable hydrogen supply (IRHS) system that includes various types of RES and hydrogen technologies such as production, storage, and transportation. We then develop a multi-period deterministic optimization model for the IRHS system by using a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) technique. The proposed model optimizes the configuration and operational strategy of the IRHS system. The capability of the proposed model is demonstrated through its application to the design problem of Korea's future hydrogen economy. We perform an economic evaluation to identify the major parameters for the required cost of the energy system infrastructure. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Non-probabilistic reliability-based design optimization (NRBDO) offers a powerful tool for structural design when uncertain-but-bounded parameters are considered. Like the reliability-based design optimization (RBDO), the NRBDO application for practical engineering structure is hindered by the huge computational effort involved in the repeated evaluation of non-probabilistic constraints. The decoupled strategy is one of the most efficient REDO strategies. However, whether it is widely applicable for NRBDO problem remains unknown. In this paper, we make attempts to develop a decoupled strategy for NRBDO convex models based on the concerned performance approach, and propose a sequential optimization approach to handle the deterministic optimization and non-probabilistic reliability analysis sequentially. A new feasibility-checking criterion is further proposed, and the non-probabilistic constraints are divided into active, inactive and violated categories. Since only concerned points of active and violated constraints are calculated accurately, the computational cost associated with non-probabilistic constraint is decreased significantly. Four examples are tested to envelop representative NRBDO problems based on interval set, single-ellipse or multi-ellipse convex model. This way, we show that the decoupled strategies could be promising for a large variety of engineering NRBDO problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a multiobjective optimization of post-tensioned concrete road bridges in terms of cost, CO2 emissions, and overall safety factor. A computer tool links the optimization modulus with a set of modules for the finite-element analysis and limit states verification. This is applied for the case study of a three-span continuous post-tensioned box-girder road bridge, located in a coastal region. A multiobjective harmony search is used to automatically search a set of optimum structural solutions regarding the geometry, concrete strength, reinforcing and post-tensioned steel. Diversification strategies are combined with intensification strategies to improve solution quality. Results indicate that cost and CO2 emissions are close to each other for any safety range. A one-euro reduction, involves a 234 kg CO2 emissions reduction. Output identifies the best variables to improve safety and the critical limit states. This tool also provides bridge managers with a set of trade-off optimum solutions, which balance their preferences most closely, and meet the requirements previously defined. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Heat loss from the kiln shell accounts for a certain proportion of total energy input in a rotary kiln. To reduce the heat loss, a novel heat recovery exchanger installed on the kiln shell is proposed to preheat water in this paper. Numerical simulations and experimental measurements are carried out to investigate the flow and heat transfer characteristics of the heat recovery exchanger. Then, multi-objective optimization models are proposed with the heat transfer area, the pressure drop and the modified entropy generation number set as objective functions. The mathematic models describe the relation between heat transfer rates and the design parameters of the heat recovery exchanger, i.e. the tube length, the tube numbers and the tube diameter. With the aid of the Matlab genetic algorithm toolbox, the optimized design parameters are obtained. Finally, economic analyses of a practical heat recovery system with nine heat recovery exchangers are proposed to estimate the saving of the fuel consumption. The optimization results show that the Pareto solutions are the trade-off between the two conflicting objective functions and give some final decisions considering specific requirements for the designers. Besides, the optimized results of heat transfer areas and pressure drop of the heat recovery exchanger are decreased by at least 18% and 11%, respectively. As the modified entropy generation number due to heat transfer and fluid friction decrease, the corresponding heat transfer area and pressure drop decrease, respectively. The economic analyses indicate that the heat recovery system is profitable and the revenue comes from the fuel savings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A 2 MW underwater compressed air energy storage (UWCAES) system is studied using both conventional and advanced exergy analyses. The exergy efficiency of the proposed UWCAES system is found to be 53.6% under the real conditions. While the theoretical maximum under the unavoidable condition is 84.3%; showing a great potential for performance improvement. Even though there are quantitative differences between conventional and advanced results, both show that the final compressor stage has the highest potential for improvement. The advanced exergy analysis reveals the real improvement potential of the UWCAES system. Further, it is revealed that the interactions between system components are complex but not very strong. Subsequently, the total exergy efficiency may not necessarily increase by improving the performance of the components individually. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we propose a multiobjective optimization framework for the sensor selection problem in uncertain Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The uncertainties of the WSNs result in a set of sensor observations with insufficient information about the target. We propose a novel mutual information upper bound (MIUB)-based sensor selection scheme, which has a low computational complexity, same as the Fisher information (FI)-based sensor selection scheme, and gives an estimation performance similar to the mutual information-based sensor selection scheme. Without knowing the number of sensors to be selected a priori, the multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) gives a set of sensor selection strategies that reveal different tradeoffs between two conflicting objectives: minimization of the number of selected sensors and minimization of the gap between the performance metric (MIUB and FI) when all the sensors transmit measurements and when only the selected sensors transmit their measurements based on the sensor selection strategy. Illustrative numerical results that provide valuable insights are presented.

AB With the explosion of data generation, getting optimal solutions to data driven problems is increasingly becoming a challenge, if not impossible. It is increasingly being recognised that applications of intelligent bio-inspired algorithms are necessary for addressing highly complex problems to provide working solutions in time, especially with dynamic problem definitions, fluctuations in constraints, incomplete or imperfect information and limited computation capacity. More and more such intelligent algorithms are thus being explored for solving different complex problems. While some studies are exploring the application of these algorithms in a novel context, other studies are incrementally improving the algorithm itself. However, the fast growth in the domain makes researchers unaware of the progresses across different approaches and hence awareness across algorithms is increasingly reducing, due to which the literature on bio-inspired computing is skewed towards few algorithms only (like neural networks, genetic algorithms, particle swarm and ant colony optimization). To address this concern, we identify the popularly used algorithms within the domain of bio-inspired algorithms and discuss their principles, developments and scope of application. Specifically, we have discussed the neural networks, genetic algorithm, particle swarm, ant colony optimization, artificial bee colony, bacterial foraging, cuckoo search, firefly, leaping frog, bat algorithm, flower pollination and artificial plant optimization algorithm. Further objectives which could be addressed by these twelve algorithms have also be identified and discussed. This review would pave the path for future studies to choose algorithms based on fitment. We have also identified other bio-inspired algorithms, where there are a lot of scope in theory development and applications, due to the absence of significant literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ambient Intelligence is the next wave in computing and communication technology. Nano-sensors, wireless networks and unified intelligent software are the main elements of this issue. Inputs of ambient intelligence are taken from sensors in the environment. Wireless sensor networks consists of small and low cost sensors that collect and report environmental data. Wireless sensors are dispersed in an area that some phenomenon or event should be monitored. When a sensor detects the monitored event (heat, pressure, sound, light, areas having magnetic properties, vibration, etc.), the event is reported to one of the sites. This site performs an appropriate task such as sending a message or local processing based on the type of network, and then provides the appropriate response. One of the major challenges in wireless sensor networks is optimizing the energy consumption. Studies have shown that by clustering network nodes, it is possible to use their energy more efficiently. This study proposes a clustering based routing method to be used in wireless sensor networks. Multi-objective optimization algorithm named as Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II is used for clustering and seven objective functions are described. It is aimed to carry out several goals at once by using multi objective algorithm. While communication cost between the objective functions and cluster-head and Sink, and cluster-head and non-cluster-head is tried to be minimized, selection of the cluster heads only from the nodes near Sink is also tried to be prevented and it is also taken into consideration for clusters to include more nodes as much as possible. Each solution of the solution set obtained with Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II points a different network topology. Each solution in solution set is the best solution according to some of objective functions. It is provided that Sink simulate each solution in solution set according to a certain scenario and choose one suitable for the desired criteria. In proposed method, both operating the Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II and, simulation and evaluation of the obtained solutions comes out in Sink which has sufficient operation and power sources. According to the results, the proposed method can make the life span of network five times longer than LEACH, which is the most famous clustering algorithm. Besides, while the proposed method extends the life span of network, it is also seen that it increases the number of the packet reaching Sink two times more than LEACH. The data provided by proposed method includes information about larger areas when compared to LEACH. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Model-based optimization approaches are valuable in developing new drugs for human metabolic disorders. The core objective in most optimal drug designs is positive therapeutic effects. In this study, we considered the effects of therapeutic, adverse, and target variation simultaneously. A fuzzy optimization method was applied to formulate a multiobjective drug design problem for detecting enzyme targets in the presynaptic dopamine metabolic network to remedy two types of enzymopathies caused by deficiencies of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). The fuzzy membership approach transforms a two-stage drug discovery problem into a unified decision-making problem. We developed a nested hybrid differential evolution algorithm to efficiently identify a set of potential drug targets. Furthermore, we also simulated the effects of current clinical drugs for Parkinson's disease (PD) in this model and tried to clarify the possible causes of neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects. The optimal drug design could yield 100% satisfaction grade when both therapeutic effect and the number of targets were considered in the objective. This scenario required regulating one to three and one or two enzyme targets for 50%-95% and 50%-100% VMAT2 and TH deficiencies, respectively. However, their corresponding adverse and target variation effect grades were less satisfactory. For the most severe deficiencies of VMAT2 and TH, a compromise design could be obtained when the effects of therapeutic, adverse, and target variation were simultaneously applied to the optimal drug discovery problem. Such a trade-off design followed the no free lunch theorem for optimization; that is, a more serious dopamine deficiency required more enzyme targets and lower satisfaction grade. In addition, the therapeutic effects of current clinical medications for PD could be enhanced in combination with new enzyme targets. The increase of toxic metabolites after treatment might be the cause of neurotoxic effects of some current PD medications.

AB An important unifying property of single and multicolumn chromatographic processes, whether discontinuous or continuous, is that they are based on timed events. The Unified Design method was revised by defining three kinds of events (cut event, fixed-bed event, SMB event). Binary and multicomponent separations in various process configurations, from single column batch to complex multicolumn units, can readily be described as combinations of such events. New dimensionless parameters were introduced to describe these events, and their combinations were used as operating parameters for different processes. Transformations between physical and dimensionless operating parameters were introduced. Regions of feasible operating parameters for complete separation of ternary mixtures with linear isotherms were derived for batch chromatography and two SMB-type processes (Japan Organo, 3W-ISMB) using the equilibrium theory. It was shown that these can be visualized and overlaid on the Unified Design operating parameter plane, which enables their direct comparison. It was found that in many cases the complete separation regions of apparently very different process schemes are identical or exhibit strong similarities. This indicates that it should be possible to transfer the operating point from one process mode to another without affecting the product purity if column efficiency is very high.

AB The multiobjective optimization method was applied in order to improve the droplet size distribution and stability of water-in-oil emulsions composed of sunflower and pumpkin seed oils as continuous phase, polyglycerol polyricinoleate as emulsifier, water as dispersed phase and sodium chloride as co-stabilizer (lipophobe). Three composition factors were varied based on the three level Box-Behnken design and three characteristics of the obtained emulsions were measured for each experimental run. The mean volume diameter of water droplets and the span of the droplet size distribution, both determined immediately upon preparation of the emulsion, as well as the stability index over a three-month period were interrelated by regression functions with the surfactant concentration, oil composition and the salt content in the water phase of the emulsion. Also, the fourth objective function based on a difference in the prices of pumpkin seed and sunflower oils was considered for optimization. The multiobjective optimum was calculated by using the minimal loss method with weight factors.
   Additionally, effects of the continuous phase composition and the salt content on the equilibrium interfacial tension of water-oil systems and the changes of the droplet size distribution over time were studied.

TI Gradient-Based Multiobjective Optimization for Maximizing Expectation
   and Minimizing Uncertainty or Risk With Application to Optimal
   Well-Control Problem With Only Bound Constraints
SO SPE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID LONG-TERM
AB We consider two procedures for multiobjective optimization, the classical weighted-sum (WS) method and the normal-boundary-intersection (NBI) method. To enhance computational efficiency, the methods use gradients calculated with the adjoint method. Our objective is to develop implementations that one can apply for waterflooding optimization under geological uncertainty when we wish to develop well controls that satisfy two objectives: The first is to maximize the expectation of life-cycle net present value (NPV) (commonly referred to as robust optimization), and the second is either to minimize the standard deviation of NPV over that set of plausible reservoir descriptions or to minimize the risk when risk means downside risk. Specifically, minimizing risk refers to maximizing the minimum value of the life-cycle NPV (i.e., is equivalent to a maximum/minimum (max/min) problem). To avoid nondifferentiability issues, we recast the max/min problem as a constrained optimization problem and apply a gradient-based version of either WS or NBI to construct a point on the Pareto front. To deal with the constraints introduced, we derive an augmented-Lagrange algorithm to find points on the Pareto front. To the best of our knowledge, the resulting versions of "constrained" WS and "constrained" NBI were not presented previously in the scientific literature. The methodology is demonstrated for two synthetic reservoirs. We only consider bound constraints in this paper.

TI Augmented Lagrangian Method for Maximizing Expectation and Minimizing
   Risk for Optimal Well-Control Problems With Nonlinear Constraints
SO SPE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHMS
AB Robust waterflooding optimization commonly refers to the problem of estimating well controls (wellbore pressures or rates at specified control steps) that maximize the expectation of net-present-value (NPV) of the life-cycle production over an ensemble of given reservoir models. Unfortunately, if the reservoir is operated under the "optimal" well controls obtained, the variance in NPV may be large; more importantly, if the smallest NPV obtained is close to the one that would be obtained for the true reservoir, the development of the reservoir might not be commercially viable. Liu and Reynolds (2015b) suggested that one way to manage risk was to consider the problem in which the dual objectives were to maximize the expected value of NPV and to minimize the risk in which the risk was defined as the minimum NPV from an ensemble of models spanning the uncertainty in reservoir description. However, the algorithms presented in Liu and Reynolds (2015b) considered only bound constraints. Here, we develop algorithms to generate points on the Pareto front when nonlinear state (output) constraints are present. The Pareto front is generated either by a constrained weighted-sum (WS) method or a constrained normal-boundary-intersection (NBI) method. In this paper, we extend the augmented Lagrangian approach given in Liu and Reynolds (2015b) for biobjective optimization with bound constraints to biobjective optimization problems in which nonlinear state constraints are present. We provide a detailed derivation of how to incorporate nonlinear constraints for multiobjective optimization problems (MOOPs) and illustrate, by means of example, that the methodology is viable for biobjective optimization with nonlinear constraints.

AB This paper focused on the calibration of Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) for the Cancela River Basin, located in Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, using the multi-objective Evolucionary Reference Point Based Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm R-NSGA. Modifications were made in SWMM structure to allow its linking with R-NSGA in MATLAB. The objective functions proposed were the efficiency coefficient of Nash-Sutcliffe (eNS), the Peak Flow Error (EQ) and Runoff Volume error (EVOL), which were applied simultaneously to the model calibration. A method for determining the maximum compatibility to rank the best solutions is proposed. The parameters estimated by SWMM calibration were close to physical values of the basin, except those relating to the Horton equation in the most compatible solutions have a better behavior for the validation event, highlighting the importance of multi-objective optimization.

AB Risk transferring strategies are the primary concern of financial risk management. Insurer companies aim to protect themselves against potentially significant losses, usually, associated with natural catastrophes. The hedging is mostly facilitated by putting risk transfer contracts in the global reinsurance market, hence, hedging the risk to bigger reinsurance companies upon the payment of a premium in a similar way as occurs when clients want to protect their properties. Thus, the problem can be summarized as maximizing the hedged risk and, at the same time, maximizing the expected return. This issue is also known as Reinsurance Contract Optimization, in which given a set of parameters such as number of layers, limits, and deductibles, we aim to discover the percentage of shares or placements that maximize the risk and the expected return. Even though this problem is discrete, it cannot be solved by an enumeration algorithm because the search space can be large. In this context, evolutionary/swarm computation represents an interesting form of addressing it. Therefore, this paper presents how the reinsurance contract optimization has been tackled using evolutionary/swarm algorithms in both single and multiobjective approaches so far.

AB Combining modern thermodynamics theory branches, including finite time thermodynamics or entropy generation minimization, constructal theory and entransy theory, with metallurgical process engineering, this paper provides a new exploration on generalized thermodynamic optimization theory for iron and steel production processes. The theoretical core is to thermodynamically optimize performances of elemental packages, working procedure modules, functional subsystems, and whole process of iron and steel production processes with real finite-resource and/or finite-size constraints with various irreversibilities toward saving energy, decreasing consumption, reducing emission and increasing yield, and to achieve the comprehensive coordination among the material flow, energy flow and environment of the hierarchical process systems. A series of application cases of the theory are reviewed. It can provide a new angle of view for the iron and steel production processes from thermodynamics, and can also provide some guidelines for other process industries.

AB In this research, for the first time, a new optimization method, i.e., strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm II (SPEA-II), is developed for the burnable poison placement (BPP) optimization of a nuclear reactor core. In the BPP problem, an optimized placement map of fuel assemblies with burnable poison is searched for a given core loading pattern according to defined objectives. In this work, SPEA-II coupled with a nodal expansion code is used for solving the BPP problem of Kraftwerk Union AG (KWU) pressurized water reactor. Our optimization goal for the BPP is to achieve a greater multiplication factor (K-eff) for gaining possible longer operation cycles along with more flattening of fuel assembly relative power distribution, considering a safety constraint on the radial power peaking factor. For appraising the proposed methodology, the basic approach, i.e., SPEA, is also developed in order to compare obtained results. In general, results reveal the acceptance performance and high strength of SPEA, particularly its new version, i.e., SPEA-II, in achieving a semi optimized loading pattern for the BPP optimization of KWU pressurized water reactor.

AB Recently, a heat source system utilizing a heat storage tank for energy savings in buildings was designed. A heat storage tank is an effective system for solving the qualitative and quantitative differences in the required building energy. On the other hand, the existing design process of a heat storage system is difficult to determine if the air-conditioning time is unclear, and the design in a real-working level is too inaccurate, causing oversizing and a high initial investment cost. This results in inefficient operation despite the introduction of an efficient system. Therefore, this study proposes an optimal design method of a heat source system using a thermal storage tank. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed design method, feasibility studies were conducted with the existing system designs. As a result, the optimal solution could reduce the initial cost by approximately 25.6% when following the conventional design process and it was approximately 40% lower than the real-working method. In conclusion, the conventional designs are inefficiently over-designed and the optimal design solution is superior. In this regard, the suggested optimal design method is efficient when designing a heat source system using a thermal storage tank.

AB We study the stability of the optimal solutions and the stationary points of the stochastic multiobjective optimization problems with complementarity constraints (SMOPCC) when the underlying probability measure varies in some metric probability space. We show under some moderate conditions that the optimal solutions and the optimal value function are continuous with respect to probability measure. Based on some new results on stochastic generalized equations, we also show that the set-valued mapping of M-stationary points is upper semi-continuous with respect to the variation of the probability measure. A particular focus is given to the empirical probability measure approximation which is also known as the sample average approximation (SAA). We present that the stationary points of SAA problems converge to their true counterparts with probability one (w.p.1.) at exponential rate as the sample size increases.

AB In this paper, a bi-objective Vehicle Routing Problem (bi-RVRP) with uncertainty in both demands and travel times is studied by means of robust optimization. Uncertain demands per customer are modeled by a discrete set of scenarios representing the deviations from an expected demand, while uncertain travel times are independent from customer demands. Then, traffic records are considered to get discrete scenarios to each arc of the transportation network. Here, the bi-RVRP aims at minimizing the worst total cost of traversed arcs and minimizing the maximum total unmet demand over all scenarios. As far as we know, this is the first study for the bi-RVRP which finds practical applications in urban transportation, e.g., serving small retail stores. To solve the problem, different variations of solution approaches, coupled with a local search procedure are proposed: the Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGAII). Different metrics are used to measure the algorithmic performance, the convergence, as well as the diversity of solutions for the different methods.

AB We assess the trade-offs and synergies involved in reducing agriculture-generated nutrient loads with different levels of resilience. We optimize the selection of least-cost patterns of agricultural conservation practices for both the expected performance of the conservation actions and its variance. Securing nutrient loads with a higher level of resilience is costly, with marginal costs of resilience generally declining with lower loads. We find that the main trade-off dimension is between cost of conservation investments and ecosystem service objectives, as opposed to pronounced mean-variance or between-nutrient objectives trade-offs. We find relative synergies in agricultural conservation investments aimed at nutrient reductions.

AB Microalgae are considered to be a promising source of biomass compared with first and second generation feedstocks. However, the high energy requirement for harvesting and drying of the algal biomass poses challenge to commercialization due to implications on both carbon footprint (CF) and cost. In this work, we propose a systematic methodology for the multi-criteria evaluation of alternatives for the harvesting and drying processes. A fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) approach is used, where the pairwise comparison of the multiple criteria and alternatives were done to prioritize the best harvesting and drying method within the fuzzy bounds of the value judgment that satisfies the consistency index. FAHP also allows the degree of confidence of the expert to be quantified. A case study of four alternatives each for the harvesting and drying process is used to demonstrate the process. Technology capability, cost and environmental impacts (comprised CF, land footprint and water footprint) are identified as the selection criteria for harvesting and drying process, respectively. Results show that flotation is the best alternative for harvesting process, while sun drying is the best among the drying alternatives. Sensitivity analysis is used to give insights on the robustness of the decision model and enables the understanding of critical criteria that would significantly influence the ranking of the alternatives. The proposed FAHP approach therefore can effectively deal with the uncertainty of judgment in the decision-making process in the evaluation of microalgae harvesting and drying processes.

AB The human dependency on finite fossil fuel has led to its drastic depletion. Along with its detrimental effects on the environment, such practice is now deemed unsustainable. This phenomenon has led to the growth for utilisation of biomass in the production of biofuels, biochemical and other related bioproducts. This waste-to-wealth strategy is no doubt highly beneficial to the society. However, the major challenge in the commercialisation of bioproducts production includes the complex conversion processes and the uncertainty in the supply and sources of biomass. Therefore, efficient supply chain management and optimisation is essential to overcome these barriers and variables that may constrain the development of a competitive and sustainable bioproducts market. This overview provides an extensional definition of biomass-to-bioproducts supply chain and systematically describes the problems and decisions along this chain. It also identifies the characteristics of a sustainable integrated biomass supply chain, and finally presents an overview of biomass supply chain synthesis and optimisation methods. Based on the existing research gap, the key challenges and potential future works are highlighted. This paper will provide readers with an initial point to understand the concept of sustainable biomass supply chain management and the synthesis and optimisation of sustainable biomass supply chain models.

AB Joint consideration of interference, resource utilization, fairness, and complexity issues is generally lacking in existing resource allocation schemes for Long-Term Evolution (LTE)/LTE-Advanced femtocell networks. To tackle this, we employ a hybrid spectrumallocation approach whereby the spectrum is split between the macrocell and its nearby interfering femtocells based on their resource demands, whereas the distant femtocells share the entire spectrum. A multiobjective problem is formulated for resource allocation between femtocells and is decomposed using a lexicographic optimization approach into two subproblems. A greedy algorithm of reasonably low complexity is proposed to solve these subproblems sequentially. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves substantial throughput and packet loss improvements in low-density femtocell deployment scenarios while performing satisfactorily in high-density femtocell deployment scenarios with substantial complexity and overhead reduction. The proposed scheme also performs nearly as well as the optimal solution obtained by exhaustive search.

AB Spouted pouches are being increasingly used in the beverage sector. However, aseptic packaging technology used for spouted pouches requires a highly complex sterilisation and rinsing process for the packaging materials before filling. This paper deals with the pouch packaging sterilisation process used in aseptic technology. A mixture composed of vaporised hydrogen peroxide and hot sterile air is injected into the package through a sterilisation nozzle. A CFD multicomponent model in ANSYS CFX (version 14.5) has been created and validated in order to simulate the real process. Based on this model, the paper aims to minimise hydrogen peroxide consumption and optimise the sterilisation treatment of the packaging. This issue has been approached using multi-objective optimisation software applied to CFD multicomponent simulations. The most suitable nozzle position inside the pouch has been established, as well as the optimal treatment time, concentration and flow rate of the sterilising mixture.

AB The gatingproperties of the inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (IP3R) are determined by the binding and unbinding capability of Ca2+ ions and IP3 messengers. With the patch clamp experiments, the stationary properties have been discussed for Xenopus oocyte type-1 IP3R(Oo-IP(3)R1), type-3 IP3R (Oo-IP(3)R3) and Spodoptera frugiperda IP3R(Sf-IP3R). In this paper, in order t oprovide insights about the relation between the observed gating characteristics and the gating parameters in different IP(3)Rs, we apply the immune algorithm to fit the parameters of a modified DeYoung-Keizer model. By comparing the fitting parameter distributions of three IP(3)Rs, we suggest that the three types of IP(3)Rs have the similar open sensitivity in responding to IP3. The Oo-IP(3)R3 channel is easy to open in responding to low Ca2+ concentration, while Sf-IP(3)Rchannel is easily inhibited in responding to high Ca2+ concentration. We also show that the IP3 binding rate is not a sensitive parameter for stationary gating dynamics for three IP(3)Rs, but the inhibitory Ca2+ binding/unbinding rates are sensitive parameters for gating dynamics for both Oo-IP3R1 and Oo-IP3R3 channels. Such differences may be important in generating the spatially and temporally complex Ca2+ oscillations in cells. Our study also demonstrates that the immune algorithm can be applied for model parameter searching in biological systems.

A recently proposed k-optimality criterion is used, which allows optimizing a large number of objectives in an evolutionary way, which is difficult to do by other methods. A number of promising optimum results, showing the optimum tradeoffs between several cost factors are identified and analyzed. The results appear to be very significant in the context of CO2 reduction challenges faced by the steel industries today.

AB Cooperation has become an essential element in spectrum sharing between the primary and secondary networks. A new trend in cooperation is to allow the primary and secondary networks to cooperate on the node level for data forwarding. This new paradigm allows to pool network resources from both the primary and secondary networks and allows users in each network to access a much richer network infrastructure in a combined network. This paper offers an in-depth study of such node-level cooperation by explaining its optimal throughput curve-the maximum achievable throughput for both the primary and secondary users. We formulate the problem as a multicriteria optimization problem with the goal of maximizing the throughput of both the primary and secondary users. Through a novel approach based on weighted Chebyshev norm, we transform the multicriteria optimization problem into a single criteria optimization problem and find a sequence of Pareto-optimal points iteratively. Based on the Pareto-optimal points, we construct the throughput curve and show that it provides an e-approximation to the optimal curve. We prove some important properties of the optimal throughput curve. Through a case study, we show that the throughput region (the area under the throughput curve) under node-level cooperation is substantially larger than that when there is no node-level cooperation.

AB When it comes to multiobjective optimization problems, the challenge is to find a solution that satisfies all the answers simultaneously. When the responses are correlated and present conflicting objectives, it is even more difficult to find an adequate solution, since most optimization techniques do not consider this information. The objective of this work is to apply Taguchi's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and principal component analysis (PCA) in order to standardize the optimization objectives, eliminate the correlation between the multiple responses, and combine them with the normal boundary intersection (NBI) method to perform a proper optimization. A case study of 12L14 free machining steel turning process is used, since it is considered an important machining operation. Three input parameters (cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut) and three response variables (mean roughness, total mean roughness, and removal rate) were considered. Response surface methodology was employed to build the objective functions. The NBI-PCA-SNR method was successfully applied, presenting viable solutions.

AB Modeling soil water flow requires the knowledge of numerous parameters associated to the water content and the soil hydraulic properties. Direct estimations of those parameters in laboratory require expensive equipment and the obtained parameters are generally not representative at the field scale because of the limitation of core sample size. Indirect methods such as inverse modeling are known to get efficient estimations and are easier to set up and process for large-scale studies. In this study, we investigated the capacity of an inverse modeling procedure to estimate the soil and the bedrock hydrodynamic properties only from in situ soil water content measurements at multiple depths under natural conditions. Multi-objective parameter optimization was performed using the HYDRUS-1D software and an external optimization procedure based on the NSGA-II algorithm. In a midslope shallow soil, water content was monitored at 3 depths, 20, 40, and 60 cm during 12 intense rainfall events, whose amounts ranged between 50 and 250 mm and duration between 1 and 5 days. The vertical profile was considered as 2 layers of soils above a third layer representing the weathered schist rock. This deep layer acted as a deep boundary condition, which features the bedrock permeability and water storage. Each layer was described trough the 6 parameters of the Mualem-van Genuchten formulation. The calibrated parameters appeared to have very low uncertainty while allowing a good modelisation of the observed water content variations. The calibrated saturated water content was close to the laboratory porosity measurements while the saturated hydraulic conductivity showed that the soil was highly permeable, as measured in the field. The inverse modeling approach allowed an estimation of the hydraulic properties of the bedrock layer where no measurement was available. The bedrock layer was found to have a low saturated hydraulic conductivity (<5 mm h(-1)), which means that the schist bedrock is poorly weathered and that saturated area can be generated above this depth, as it was observed. The simulated water contents were generally close to the measured water contents, but the model failed sometimes to reproduce the saturation of the soil in the deeper layers, probably because of sub-surface flux at the soil/bedrock interface. In these cases, further investigation will have to be made by using a 2D-model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Determining cost-effective configurations of best management practices (BMPs) is a notably complex problem, especially for large-scale watersheds. In this paper, a Markov-based simulator that has been developed to quantify water quality responses is described, and a new framework is also proposed for the optimal design of BMPs by integrating the Markov approach, a watershed model, and an evolutionary algorithm. This new framework was then tested in a typical watershed, the Three Georges Reservoir Region in China. The results obtained from this application indicate the integration of water quality responses is vital for the optimal design of BMPs, especially for the downstream areas of the targeted river assessment section. The Markov-based algorithm had a computational advantage over traditional algorithm and this new algorithm offers the prospect of providing more cost-effective medium-cost solutions. The relative impacts of upstream BMPs were also highlighted in protecting water quality at multiple river assessment sections. This new algorithm can easily be extended to any other watershed to aid decision managers in the optimal design of BMPs at the watershed scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Despite their inherent attractive characteristics, microalgae do not play a significant role in the green energy market because of high production cost. In order to propel this nascent industry one step further towards commercial viability, the present study expands the narrow outlook of previous studies which is restricted to a single location into a perspective with a nationwide network by proposing a sustainable supply chain model capable of revealing opportunities and limitations of algae industry's future. The proposed model is formulated based on batch and continuous production systems which completely cover the possible future configuration of microalgae-based biofuel supply chain and also offers managerial implications contributing to cost mitigation. Moreover, the uncertainty whose importance is accentuated in the case of algae production due to lack of real-world implementation is captured by the utilization of robust optimization under two norms of the uncertain data vector. A real case study is carried out to explore the applicability of the proposed model. Furthermore, robust sensitivity analysis technique is performed, allowing decision makers to analyze the effect of uncertain parameters on production cost based on their confidence levels.

AB Public investment in river restoration through environmental watering has increased substantially in recent years. To sustain public support for such investment, management of environmental water must achieve the best possible outcomes in a transparent and defensible manner. The current management of environmental water relies on the ability of managers to estimate the impacts of their decisions under complex scenarios, often with multiple interdependent decisions that span over different spatial and temporal scales. Optimization modeling has been widely used in other forms of conservation management and an increasing body of literature documents the development of optimization models that could be used to improve environmental water decisions. This paper reviews this disparate research, showing that there are a range of different questions addressed using this modeling approach and that the representation of environmental outcomes varies. Future work must focus on improved adoption through engagement with end users and stakeholders during model development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We address the problem of minimizing the long-run expected average cost of a complex system consisting of interactive subsystems. We formulate a multiobjective optimization problem of the one-stage expected costs of the subsystems and provide a duality framework to prove that the control policy yielding the Pareto optimal solution minimizes the average cost criterion of the system. We provide the conditions of existence and a geometric interpretation of the solution. For practical situations with constraints consistent to those studied here, our results imply that the Pareto control policymay be of value when we seek to derive online the optimal control policy in complex systems.

AB Separated collection is an important part of waste management, because it allows material recovery. In order to organize separate collection operations, complex decisions need to be taken on the basis of a large amount of data. In this paper, the problem of planning the door-to-door waste collection of multiple materials for a municipality is considered. A few contributions are available in the literature for this problem. A new mixed integer linear programming model is formalized and solved. A multiobjective optimization model is proposed, aiming at minimizing both operational costs and possible inefficiencies of the recycling logistic system causing negative environmental impacts. The model is applied to a real case study and a mixed integer programming heuristic algorithm is used for its solution. The obtained results are discussed and conclusions are drawn.
   Note to Practitioners-The aim of this paper is to deliver models, methods, and ICT tools to significantly reduce costs and environmental impacts for the door-to-door recycling of multiple materials. The focus is on the tactical planning the logistic of the recycling service (i.e., operational management not considering routing) through the formulation and solution of a multiobjective optimization problem. The considered decision problem is representative of a classical situation in Italian municipalities, where waste collection is organized by public administrations for large areas and there is still not the capability of managing in real-time optimal routing. The model was applied to a real case study and the results show that the proposed optimization algorithm managed to achieve a saving of 23% for the overall operational cost.

AB Hospitals are huge and complex systems. However, for many years, the management was commonly focused on improving the quality of the medical care, while less attention was usually devoted to operation management. In recent years, the need of containing the costs while increasing the competitiveness along with the new policies of National Health Service hospital financing forced hospitals to necessarily improve their operational efficiency. In this paper, we focus on a management problem usually arising in health care. In particular, we deal with optimal resource allocation of a ward of a big hospital. To this aim, we propose a simulation-based optimization approach that makes use of a discrete-event simulation model, reproducing the hospital services and combined with a derivative-free multiobjective optimization method. The results obtained on the obstetrics ward of an Italian hospital are reported, showing the effectiveness of the new approach proposed.
   Note to Practitioners-In the last years, reducing health care costs while providing high-quality health care services became a critical issue, and hence the necessity to make available to health care practitioners a decision support system for determining an optimal resources allocation. In this paper, we develop a simulation-based optimization framework that combines a simulation model reproducing the main processes of a specific hospital ward with a multiobjective optimization algorithm in order to find an approximate optimal resources allocation. The proposed approach can be used in practice by decision makers in order to adjust the allocation of resources in a given ward. The results obtained on a real obstetrics ward of an Italian hospital show that the proposed approach is viable in practice and allows practitioners to adopt the best strategy according to specific indicators related to clinical risk, quality of the care provided, economical benefits both for patients, hospitals, and for the National Health Service.

AB It is known that Pareto dominance has its own weaknesses as the selection criterion in evolutionary multiobjective optimization. Algorithms based on Pareto criterion (PC) can suffer from problems such as slow convergence to the optimal front and inferior performance on problems with many objectives. Non-Pareto criterion (NPC), such as decomposition-based criterion and indicator-based criterion, has already shown promising results in this regard, but its high selection pressure may lead to the algorithm to prefer some specific areas of the problem's Pareto front, especially when the front is highly irregular. In this paper, we propose a bi-criterion evolution (BCE) framework of the PC and NPC, which attempts to make use of their strengths and compensates for each other's weaknesses. The proposed framework consists of two parts: PC evolution and NPC evolution. The two parts work collaboratively, with an abundant exchange of information to facilitate each other's evolution. Specifically, the NPC evolution leads the PC evolution forward and the PC evolution compensates the possible diversity loss of the NPC evolution. The proposed framework keeps the freedom on the implementation of the NPC evolution part, thus making it applicable for any non-Pareto-based algorithm. In the PC evolution, two operations, population maintenance and individual exploration, are presented. The former is to maintain a set of representative nondominated individuals and the latter is to explore some promising areas that are undeveloped (or not well-developed) in the NPC evolution. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The BCE works well on seven groups of 42 test problems with various characteristics, including those in which Pareto-based algorithms or non-Pareto-based algorithms struggle.

AB In recent years, multiobjective immune algorithms (MOIAs) have shown promising performance in solving multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). However, basic MOIAs only use a single hypermutation operation to evolve individuals, which may induce some difficulties in tackling complicated MOPs. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid evolutionary framework for MOIAs, in which the cloned individuals are divided into several subpopulations and then evolved using different evolutionary strategies. An example of this hybrid framework is implemented, in which simulated binary crossover and differential evolution with polynomial mutation are adopted. A fine-grained selection mechanism and a novel elitism sharing strategy are also adopted for performance enhancement. Various comparative experiments are conducted on 28 test MOPs and our empirical results validate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our proposed algorithm in solving MOPs of different types.

AB For many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs), in which the number of objectives is greater than three, the performance of most existing evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms generally deteriorates over the number of objectives. As some MaOPs may have redundant or correlated objectives, it is desirable to reduce the number of the objectives in such circumstances. However, the Pareto solution of the reduced MaOP obtained by most of the existing objective reduction methods, based on objective selection, may not be the Pareto solution of the original MaOP. In this paper, we propose an objective extraction method (OEM) for MaOPs. It formulates the reduced objective as a linear combination of the original objectives to maximize the conflict between the reduced objectives. Subsequently, the Pareto solution of the reduced MaOP obtained by the proposed algorithm is that of the original MaOP, and the proposed algorithm can thus preserve the dominance structure as much as possible. Moreover, we propose a novel framework that features both simple and complicated Pareto set shapes for many-objective test problems with an arbitrary number of essential objectives. Within this framework, we can control the importance of essential objectives. As there is no direct performance metric for the objective reduction algorithms on the benchmarks, we present a new metric that features simplicity and usability for the objective reduction algorithms. We compare the proposed OEM with three objective reduction methods, i.e., REDGA, L-PCA, and NL-MVU-PCA, on the proposed test problems and benchmark DTLZ5 with different numbers of objectives and essential objectives. Our numerical studies show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.

AB In evolutionary multiobjective optimization, maintaining a good balance between convergence and diversity is particularly crucial to the performance of the evolutionary algorithms (EAs). In addition, it becomes increasingly important to incorporate user preferences because it will be less likely to achieve a representative subset of the Pareto-optimal solutions using a limited population size as the number of objectives increases. This paper proposes a reference vector-guided EA for many-objective optimization. The reference vectors can be used not only to decompose the original multiobjective optimization problem into a number of single-objective subproblems, but also to elucidate user preferences to target a preferred subset of the whole Pareto front (PF). In the proposed algorithm, a scalarization approach, termed angle-penalized distance, is adopted to balance convergence and diversity of the solutions in the high-dimensional objective space. An adaptation strategy is proposed to dynamically adjust the distribution of the reference vectors according to the scales of the objective functions. Our experimental results on a variety of benchmark test problems show that the proposed algorithm is highly competitive in comparison with five state-of-the-art EAs for many-objective optimization. In addition, we show that reference vectors are effective and cost-efficient for preference articulation, which is particularly desirable for many-objective optimization. Furthermore, a reference vector regeneration strategy is proposed for handling irregular PFs. Finally, the proposed algorithm is extended for solving constrained many-objective optimization problems.

AB Under mild conditions, the Pareto front (Pareto set) of a continuous m-objective optimization problem forms an (m - 1)-dimensional piecewise continuous manifold. Based on this property, this paper proposes a self-organizing multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. At each generation, a self-organizing mapping method with (m - 1) latent variables is applied to establish the neighborhood relationship among current solutions. A solution is only allowed to mate with its neighboring solutions to generate a new solution. To reduce the computational overhead, the self-organizing training step and the evolution step are conducted in an alternative manner. In other words, the self-organizing training is performed only one single step at each generation. The proposed algorithm has been applied to a number of test instances and compared with some state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary methods. The results have demonstrated its advantages over other approaches.

AB In general, an M-objective continuous optimization problem has an (M - 1)-dimensional Pareto front in the objective space. If its dimension is smaller than (M - 1), it is called a degenerate Pareto front. Deb-Thiele-Laumanns-Zitzler (DTLZ)5 and Walking Fish Group (WFG)3 have often been used as many-objective continuous test problems with degenerate Pareto fronts. However, it was noted that DTLZ5 has a nondegenerate part of the Pareto front. Constraints have been proposed to remove the nondegenerate part. In this letter, first we show that WFG3 also has a nondegenerate part. Then, we derive constraints to remove the nondegenerate part. Finally, we show that the existence of the nondegenerate part makes WFG3 an interesting test problem through computational experiments.

AB Supporting effective load balancing is paramount for increasing network utilization efficiency and improving the perceivable user experience in emerging and future cellular networks. At the same time, it is becoming increasingly alarming that current communication practices lead to excessive energy wastes both at the infrastructure side and at the terminals. To address both these issues, this paper discusses an innovative communication approach enabled by the implementation of device-to-device (d2d) communication over cellular networks. The technique capitalizes on the delay tolerance of a significant portion of Internet applications and the inherent mobility of the nodes to achieve significant performance gains. For delay-tolerant messages, a mobile node can postpone message transmission-in a store-carry and forward manner-for a later time to allow the terminal to achieve communication over a shorter range or to postpone communication to when the terminal enters a cooler cell, before engaging in communication. Based on this framework, a theoretical model is introduced to study the generalized multihop d2d forwarding scheme where mobile nodes are allowed to buffer messages and carry them while in transit. Thus, a multiobjective optimization problem is introduced where both the communication cost and the varying load levels of multiple cells are to be minimized. We show that the mathematical programming model that arises can be efficiently solved in time. Furthermore, extensive numerical investigations reveal that the proposed scheme is an effective approach for both energy-efficient communication and offering significant gains in terms of load balancing in multicell topologies.

AB This study explores the inclusion of a groundwater recharge based design objective and the impact it has on the design of optimum groundwater monitoring networks. The study was conducted in the Hamilton, Halton, and Credit Valley regions of Ontario, Canada, in which the existing Ontario Provincial Groundwater Monitoring Network was augmented with additional monitoring wells. The Dual Entropy-Multiobjective Optimization (DEMO) model was used in these analyses. The value of using this design objective is rooted in the information contained within the estimated recharge. Recharge requires knowledge of climate, geomorphology, and geology of the area, thus using this objective function can help account for these physical characteristics. Two sources of groundwater recharge data were examined and compared, the first was calculated using the Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS), and the second was an aggregation of recharge found using both the PRMS and Hydrological Simulation Program Fortran (HSP-F). The entropy functions are used to identify optimal trade-offs between the maximum information content and the minimum shared information between the monitoring wells. The recharge objective will help to quantify hydrological characteristics of the vadose zone, and thus provide more information to the optimization algorithm. Results show that by including recharge as a design objective, the spatial coverage of the monitoring network can be improved. The study also highlights the flexibility of DEMO and its ability to incorporate additional design objectives such as the groundwater recharge. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper explores the optimal design problem of a linear time-invariant control system composed of three different types of linear parallel actuators. The actuators' time constants have been defined to achieve a conflicting behavior among the transient response provided by them. Thus, a novel solution has been proposed to find the best selection of actuators' gains to improve the performance parameters. Such methodology is based on a discrete multiobjective optimization technique. The transfer functions, as well as the transient response, have been derived and evaluated throughout this work. In addition, the stability conditions have been analyzed for a range of closed-loop poles and zeros. The discrete multiobjective optimization problem is formulated with a couple of objective functions: overshoot and settling time of the closed-loop response. A decision-making method has been used to find the best compromise solution from a group of candidate solutions. The results have indicated that a better performance can be achieved with a systematic multiobjective optimization methodology.

AB A novel algorithm for creating a computationally efficient approximation of a system response that is defined by a boundary value problem is presented. More specifically, the approach presented is focused on substantially reducing the computational expense required to approximate the solution of a stochastic partial differential equation, particularly for the purpose of estimating the solution to an associated nondestructive evaluation problem with significant system uncertainty. In order to achieve this computational efficiency, the approach combines reduced-basis reduced-order modeling with a sparse grid collocation surrogate modeling technique to estimate the response of the system of interest with respect to any designated unknown parameters, provided the distributions are known. The reduced-order modeling component includes a novel algorithm for adaptive generation of a data ensemble based on a nested grid technique, to then create the reduced-order basis. The capabilities and potential applicability of the approach presented are displayed through two simulated case studies regarding inverse characterization of material properties for two different physical systems involving some amount of significant uncertainty. The first case study considered characterization of an unknown localized reduction in stiffness of a structure from simulated frequency response function based nondestructive testing. Then, the second case study considered characterization of an unknown temperature-dependent thermal conductivity of a solid from simulated thermal testing. Overall, the surrogate modeling approach was shown through both simulated examples to provide accurate solution estimates to inverse problems for systems represented by stochastic partial differential equations with a fraction of the typical computational cost.

AB Paired pectoral fins that are capable of rowing motions are an important actuation mechanism for robotic fish. Existing work in this area typically adopts a rigid connection between the actuator and the pectoral fins, which requires a faster actuation speed in the power stroke than in the recovery stroke to produce a net thrust or moment. In addition to increasing the control complexity, the latter requirement leads to slow robot speeds due to prolonged deceleration during the recovery stroke. In this paper, we propose the design of a novel flexible passive joint that connects the servomotor arm to the pectoral fin, to overcome the aforementioned problem. A dynamic model is developed for the joint and for a robotic fish equipped with such joints. The design and the model are evaluated with extensive experimental results. With symmetric actuation patterns during the power and recovery strokes, the robotic fish with the proposed joints shows clear speed advantage over the case involving rigid joints and asymmetric actuation. Motivated by the need for design optimization, the model is further utilized to investigate the influence of the joint length and stiffness on the robot locomotion performance and efficiency. It is found that, for low fin-beat frequencies, longer or more flexible joints lead to higher speeds, and the trend is reversed at high fin-beat frequencies. On the other hand, while the mechanical efficiency shows a decreasing trend when the frequency increases, it is higher with shorter joints. These findings suggest the utility of the proposed model for multiobjective design of the joint and its operating frequency.

AB The present work concerns an investigation and optimization of hard turning behavior of AISI 52100 bearing steel with CBN tool. The combined effects of the process parameters (cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut, cutting time, and workpiece hardness) on performance characteristics (tool wear, surface roughness, and cutting forces) are investigated through the analysis of variance (ANOVA). Also, the relationship between process parameters and performance characteristics through the artificial neural networks and response surface methodologies are modeled. Moreover, an attempt has been made to find the best process parameters combination that optimizes simultaneously the performance characteristics. For this purpose, the particle swarm optimization-based neural network (PSO-NN) hybrid model and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II)-based RSM models are proposed and compared for their performances. The results show that the workpiece hardness strongly influences the cutting forces, and it plays a dominant role in the tool wear and the surface roughness variations as compared to other process parameters. The depth of cut affects strongly the cutting forces. The cutting time has a considerable effect on all performance characteristics. They show, also, that the artificial neural network (ANN) model estimates the performance characteristics with high accuracy as compared to the RSM models. Moreover, it was found that NSGA II and PSO-NN approaches performed efficiently and they predicted near similar results. Furthermore, the NSGA-II exhibits better performance when compared to the PSO-NN methodology. However, the PSO-NN has been shown to outperform the NSGA-II methodology in computational time.

AB Reservoir modeling is a powerful tool to thoroughly assess chemical EOR performances and to design the economically optimal injection sequence (chemicals concentration, slugs size). However, while building a model requires a large amount of data, laboratory experiments allow assessing a non-exhaustive number of parameters only. Some essential data besides remain costly or time-consuming to acquire. The calibration process is thus not straightforward and typically results in under-constrained models that may not provide meaningful results.
   To increase the model robustness, we propose to carry out a multiobjective assisted calibration, further tested on an additional differentiating experiment. The multi-objective aspect refers to the calibration of various production data acquired from a consistent series of recovery experiments. The methodology is applied to five surfactantpolymer displacements performed on sandstone cores, differing from the surfactant slug concentration, its size and the brine salinity. The experiments set is chosen to provide a wide range of tertiary recoveries, from 52% to 86% of residual oil in place. The oil recovery and the differential pressure are history matched with a limited number of adjustable parameters among which the surfactant adsorption, the wateroil interfacial tension and the extrapolation of Corey exponents along flooding history.
   The sensitivity to adjustable parameters is thoroughly explored by more than 1000 simulations to finally get a model that successfully reproduces the main features of the experiments. Calibration on a few experiments then gives more confidence in the model than when done on a single experiment. Its ability to reproduce the processes occurring in the core and to further predict the optimal chemical injection sequence is reinforced by the additional differentiating experiment which segregates different consistent models. This additional experiment specifically better constrains the surfactant adsorption. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A strategic investment plan to establish renewable energy source (RES) systems plays an important role in various decision-making processes, from a stakeholder in business purposes to a policy maker for public benefits. In this study, we have developed a new optimization model to establish efficient investment strategies to design and operate a biomass to hydrogen (B2H2) system, which includes the features of RES (e.g., intermittent availability) and RES technologies (e.g., low conversion efficiency) along with various external factors on energy economy (energy price fluctuation and demand uncertainty). As a result, we identified the optimal long-term plan of investment strategy including timing, utilized amount, and capacity of facilities. In addition, we performed an economic sensitivity analysis for major parameters and evaluated a sustainability of the B2H2 system using additional metrics such as energy security and environmental protection.

AB In this study, we developed a new multiple criteria optimization method in the context of engineering design. The design of experiment (DoE) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods are combined to identify an objective function of the selected problem by fitting a polynomial to the experimental data in a multiple linear regression analysis. Then, the regression function is incorporated into a mathematical model with the criteria constraints to determine an optimal criteria set. The proposed method can be used to compare the functionality and results provided by different scenario analyses of a building design optimization problem, which represent design solutions. We applied the DoE-TOPSIS model to solve different multi-criteria design optimization problems using two examples from the literature and obtained satisfactory results. In the examples, the results obtained using the combined DoE-TOPSIS model are almost in agreement with those derived from conventional multi-criteria design optimization methods, which demonstrates the simplicity, usability, and flexibility of the proposed method in solving engineering design problems.

AB Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of disability and injury-related death. To enhance our ability to prevent such injuries, brain response can be studied using validated finite element (FE) models. In the current study, a high-resolution, anatomically accurate FE model was developed from the International Consortium for Brain Mapping brain atlas. Due to wide variation in published brain material parameters, optimal brain properties were identified using a technique called Latin hypercube sampling, which optimized material properties against three experimental cadaver tests to achieve ideal biomechanics. Additionally, falx pretension and thickness were varied in a lateral impact variation. The atlas-based brain model (ABM) was subjected to the boundary conditions from three high-rate experimental cadaver tests with different material parameter combinations. Local displacements, determined experimentally using neutral density targets, were compared to displacements predicted by the ABM at the same locations. Error between the observed and predicted displacements was quantified using CORrelation and Analysis (CORA), an objective signal rating method that evaluates the correlation of two curves. An average CORA score was computed for each variation and maximized to identify the optimal combination of parameters. The strongest relationships between CORA and material parameters were observed for the shear parameters. Using properties obtained through the described multiobjective optimization, the ABM was validated in three impact configurations and shows good agreement with experimental data. The final model developed in this study consists of optimized brain material properties and was validated in three cadaver impacts against local brain displacement data.

AB Since it first appeared, differential evolution (DE), one of the most successful evolutionary algorithms, has been studied by many researchers. Theoretical and empirical studies of the parameters and strategies have been conducted, and numerous variants have been proposed. Opposition-based DE (ODE), one of such variants, combines DE with opposition-based learning (OBL) to obtain a high-quality solution with low-computational effort. In this paper, we propose a novel OBL using a beta distribution with partial dimensional change and selection switching and combine it with DE to enhance the convergence speed and searchability. Our proposed algorithm is tested on various test functions and compared with standard DE and other ODE variants. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the comparison group, especially in terms of solution accuracy.

AB This paper proposes a brushless double mechanical port flux-switching permanent-magnet motor for potential application in hybrid electric vehicles. To realize the design objectives of high-torque capability, low-torque ripple, and low-magnetic coupling between the inner and outer motors, a new multilevel design optimization method is proposed to conduct a multiobjectives optimization. First, by adopting the comprehensive sensitivity approach, the whole optimization design process is divided into three levels: nonsensitive level, mild-sensitive level, and strong-sensitive level. Then, to improve the whole design efficiency, the response surface method and multiobjective genetic algorithm are applied in the mild-sensitive level and strong-sensitive level, respectively. Based on the proposed design method, a compromise design among the three design objectives is considered and realized. Finally, a prototype motor is built to verify the validity of the proposed design method and motor operation.

AB We extend the so-called approximate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition from a scalar optimization problem with equality and inequality constraints to a multiobjective optimization problem. We prove that this condition is necessary for a point to be a local weak efficient solution without any constraint qualification, and is also sufficient under convexity assumptions. We also state that an enhanced Fritz John-type condition is also necessary for local weak efficiency, and under the additional quasi-normality constraint qualification becomes an enhanced Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition. Finally, we study some relations between these concepts and the notion of bounded approximate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition, which is introduced in this paper.

AB Practical applications in multidisciplinary engineering design, business management, and military planning require distributed solution approaches for solving nonconvex, multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). Under this motivation, a quadratic scalarization method (QSM) is developed with the goal to preserve decomposable structures of the MOP while addressing nonconvexity in a manner that avoids a high degree of nonlinearity and the introduction of additional nonsmoothness. Under certain assumptions, necessary and sufficient conditions for QSM-generated solutions to be weakly and properly efficient for an MOP are developed, with any form of efficiency being understood in a local sense. QSM is shown to correspond with the relaxed, reformulated weighted-Chebyshev method as a special case. An example is provided for demonstrating the application of QSM to a nonconvex MOP.

AB To achieve lightweight vehicle door, this paper presents a novel design with a hybrid material tailor-welded structure (HMTWS). A multiobjective optimization procedure is adopted to generate a set of solutions, in which the door stiffness and mass are taken as objective functions, and the material types and plate thicknesses are regarded as the discrete and continuous design variables, respectively. To improve the optimization efficiency, Kriging algorithm is used for generating surrogate model through a sequential sampling strategy. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is employed to perform the multiobjective optimization. It is found that for the same computational cost, the sequential sampling strategy can yield more accurate optimization results than the conventional one-step sampling strategy. Most importantly, HMTWS is found more competent than the traditional thin-walled configurations made of steel or other lighter mono-materials for maximizing the usage of materials and stiffness of the vehicular door structures.

ID MULTIOBJECTIVE GENETIC ALGORITHM; 1D SEARCH ALGORITHMS; SYSTEMS
AB Automatic hardware/software partitioning relies on characterization, estimation and design space exploration of the system performance and cost metrics. In real world situations, such estimates are complicated and cannot be 100 percent accurate. Furthermore, hardware/software co-design is so complicated nowadays that simply considering the bipartitioning between hardware and software is not sufficient. It is important to consider some of the other key design parameters and resource sharing together with the hardware/software partitioning problem. Under variable requirements of smart systems, more flexibility on the resource usage should be incorporated in system modelling. This paper considers uncertainty modeling for system partitioning with an enhanced set of parameters for hardware/software resource sharing. We harness state-of-the-art uncertainty theory for linear uncertain distribution and normal uncertain distribution. Our derivations convert the uncertainty model back to a regular constraint optimization problem. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach.

AB Water grids are emerging as a means to address water scarcity in urban areas. These water grids are more complex than traditional supply systems, bringing new challenges to water-grid management. This paper seeks to address these challenges by demonstrating the capability of multiobjective optimization to aid in short-term operational planning for water grids. A framework for applying multiobjective optimization to short-term operational planning is demonstrated for a case study based on the South East Queensland Water Grid in Australia. The aim of the case study application is to find short-term (1year) operating rules that maximize water security, minimize operational cost, and minimize spills from reservoirs. The results of the optimization process are a number of operating options, comprising sets of operating rules that perform optimally in terms of the objectives. The range of operating rules and objective performance found in the optimization process allows the decision-maker to explore the trade-offs in decision-making and to choose a set of operating rules based on their preferences on the management objectives.

AB This paper developed a multiobjective stochastic fractional goal programming (MOSFGP) model for optimal water resources allocation among industries based on analyses of water resources quantity, quality, and uncertainty. The model integrated chance constrained programming, fractional programming, and multiobjective goal programming. The developed model was then applied in a real-world case study. The developed MOSFGP has the following advantages: (1)the model deals with economic and social objectives simultaneously, thus reflecting the actual situation more realistically; (2)the model in fractional form can determine water resources use efficiency directly; (3)water quantity and water quality are coupled in the model; and (4)the model can generate different optimal schemes under different risk probabilities. Based on the results of the MOSFGP model, decision makers could use water resources efficiently and obtain higher economic and social benefits. The model is also of great significance to industrial structure optimization, which means adjusting the industrial structures on the basis of optimal water resources allocation schemes to achieve the goal of economic planning and sustainable development.

AB MOEA/D is one of the promising evolutionary algorithms for multi- and many-objective optimization. To improve the search performance of MOEA/D, this work focuses on the solution update method in the conventional MOEA/D and proposes its alternative, the chain-reaction solution update. The proposed method is designed to maintain and improve the variable (genetic) diversity in the population by avoiding duplication of solutions in the population. In addition, the proposed method determines the order of existing solutions to be updated depending on the location of each offspring in the objective space. Furthermore, when an existing solution in the population is replaced by a new offspring, the proposed method tries to reutilize the existing solution for other search directions by recursively performing the proposed chain-reaction update procedure. This work uses discrete knapsack and continuous WFG4 problems with 2-8 objectives. Experimental results using knapsack problems show the proposed chain-reaction update contributes to improving the search performance of MOEA/D by enhancing the diversity of solutions in the objective space. In addition, experimental results using WFG4 problems show that the search performance of MOEA/D can be further improved using the proposed method.

AB Preference information (such as the reference point) of the decision maker (DM) is often used in multiobjective optimization; however, the location of the specified reference point has a detrimental effect on the performance of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). Inspired by multiobjective evolutionary algorithm-based decomposition (MOEA/D), this paper proposes an MOEA to decompose the preference information of the reference point specified by the DM into a number of scalar optimization subproblems and deals with them simultaneously (called MOEA/D-PRE). This paper presents an approach of iterative weight to map the desired region of the DM, which makes the algorithm easily obtain the desired region. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm outperforms two popular preference-based approaches, g-dominance and r-dominance, on continuous multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs), especially on many-objective optimization problems. Moreover, this study develops distinct models to satisfy different needs of the DM, thus providing a new way to deal with preference-based multiobjective optimization. Additionally, in terms of the shortcoming of MOEA/D-PRE, an improved MOEA/D-PRE that dynamically adjusts the size of the preferred region is proposed and has better performance on some problems.

AB Sufficient mixing between the supersonic airstream and the injectant is critical for the design of scramjet engines. The information in the two-dimensional supersonic jet-to-crossflow flow field has been explored numerically and theoretically, and the numerical approach has been validated against the available experimental data in the open literature. The obtained results show that the extreme difference analysis approach can obtain deeper information than the variance analysis method, and the optimal strategy can be generated by the extreme difference analysis approach. The jet-to-crossflow pressure ratio is the most important influencing factor for the supersonic jet-to-crossflow flow field, following is the injection angle, and all the design variables have no remarkable impact on the separation length and the height of Mach disk in the range considered in the current study.

AB Retrofitting building systems is known to provide cost-effective energy savings. However, prioritizing retrofits and computing their expected energy savings and cost/benefits can be a complicated, costly, and an uncertain effort. Prioritizing retrofits for a portfolio of buildings can be even more difficult if the owner must determine different investment strategies for each of the buildings. Meanwhile, we are seeing greater availability of data on building energy use, characteristics, and equipment. These data provide opportunities for the development of algorithms that link building characteristics and retrofits empirically. In this paper we explore the potential of using such data for predicting the expected energy savings from equipment retrofits for a large number of buildings. We show that building data with statistical algorithms can provide savings estimates when detailed energy audits and physics-based simulations are not cost- or time-feasible. We develop a multivariate linear regression model with numerical predictors (e.g., operating hours, occupant density) and categorical indicator variables (e.g., climate zone, heating system type) to predict energy use intensity. The model quantifies the contribution of building characteristics and systems to energy use, and we use it to infer the expected savings when modifying particular equipment. We verify the model using residual analysis and cross-validation. We demonstrate the retrofit analysis by providing a probabilistic estimate of energy savings for several hypothetical building retrofits. We discuss the ways understanding the risk associated with retrofit investments can inform decision making. The contributions of this work are the development of a statistical model for estimating energy savings, its application to a large empirical building dataset, and a discussion of its use in informing building retrofit decisions.

AB Indoor Environment Quality (IEQ) of an office has significant effects on the performance and productivity of its occupants. There are several factors that have positive or negative impacts on occupants' overall satisfaction, including the level of thermal comfort, visual comfort, aural comfort and Indoor Air Quality (IAQ). While keeping energy savings objectives, energy management system can provide acceptable thermal comfort, visual comfort, and IAQ levels, by taking energy-related decisions. Several inputs that are changing continuously, such as energy prices, sets of indoor and outdoor environment parameters, occupants' presence, activities and preferences are required for timely energy-related decision-making. Therefore, there is a need for a well-structured method to reach optimum decisions for energy costs and occupants' IEQ The main interest of this research is to propose a Multi-Objective Optimization (MOOP) method for energy and comfort management in commercial buildings. The proposed method is capable of providing situation-specific economic optimum indoor conditions, based on the combination of thermal comfort, IAQ and energy costs, as well as energy prices, occupancy information and types of occupants' activities. Operation of the proposed method is analyzed by annual energy performance simulation of a commercial building in Montreal, Canada. Based on provided results, the proposed MOOP method is capable of improving productivity of occupants, by up to $1000 per year per person, while reaching energy savings objectives. It is observed that potential for productivity improvement is higher during the swing and warm seasons, compared to the cold season. Having ability of flexible decision-making, the proposed MOOP method is suitable for Intelligent Energy Management Systems (IEMSs), with objectives of maximizing energy costs and comfort conditions.

AB Building sector is responsible for 40% of European energy consumption, of which heating and cooling account for around 70%. Moreover, 75% of buildings for 2050 are already built in Europe. On the road to a sustainable energy transition, this article develops a multi-criteria assessment methodology for the environmental, economic and social evaluation of different residential energy retrofit solutions, based on effectiveness indices. This methodology allows improving the decision management in residential energy retrofitting by identifying the most effective solutions according to the requirements and needs of each intervening agent (citizens, public administrations and private promoters). The methodology is based on the integrated analysis of environmental, economic and social variables. It is applied to a Mediterranean case study from Southern Spain built in 1955. As part of methodology, survey data from the different stakeholders were collected, identifying the keys that condition the viability of the measures. The results show that measures with few inconveniences to tenants, investment costs below 2000(sic)/dwelling and payback periods below 15 years are the most viable by end-users' implementation in the Mediterranean area, but between them, only efficient heat pumps allow achieving more than 45% of CO2 emissions reduction (with a payback period of 6 years).

AB The future of masonry buildings with heritage values is certain - the investments in making such buildings energy-efficient during renovations to meet the energy consumption requirements will increase over the next decade. However, decision makers fail to address the concerns of each project actor and give specific answers on how basic requirements on such historical buildings can be implemented. This paper proposes a new multi-criteria group decision-making method for the thermal renovation of masonry buildings. The aim of the proposed method is to rank different renovation solutions. The method uses; the structured group interaction method Delphi to define the evaluation criteria and the thermal renovations solutions, Swing method to facilitate the process of the determination of the criteria weights, the group decision support system (PROMETHEE GDSS) to reach a global ranking of the renovations solutions, PROMETHEE V to introduce additional constraints, as well as the Graphical Analysis for Interactive Aid (GAIA) analysis to get a better understanding of conflicts and similarities between the criteria and among the decision makers. We proceed to exemplify by means of a real-life case project in Algeria and offer suggestions on what front-ended stakeholders could do to reduce the energy consumption in masonry buildings.

AB Computational optimizations of dual-fuel reactivity controlled compression ignition combustion and gasoline compression ignition combustion were performed using a novel adaptive dual-fuel injector capable of direct injecting both gasoline and diesel fuel in a single cycle. Optimization used the Engine Research Center KIVA code coupled with a multiobjective genetic algorithm. Model validation was performed by comparing simulation results to conventional diesel, reactivity controlled compression ignition, and gasoline compression ignition combustion, and the validated model was used to develop an optimum reactivity controlled compression ignition-gasoline compression ignition combustion strategy. The reactivity controlled compression ignition optimization results showed that by direct injecting gasoline and diesel fuel, the gasoline quantity can be held at a high percentage across the range of loads considered. In this study, the mode weighted gasoline percentage was 91%. At the lightest load point, direct injecting the gasoline gave optimum results, whereas for the other load points, premixing the gasoline yielded the optimum results. The optimized results were compared with conventional diesel combustion, and it was seen that reactivity controlled compression ignition combustion gives a cycle-averaged improvement of 33% in gross indicated efficiency over conventional diesel combustion. The cycle-averaged NOx and soot emissions were reduced by 95% and 75%, respectively. To demonstrate operation over the entire operating map, an optimization was performed at a high-speed-high-load (16bar, 2500r/min) condition. Optimization results showed that a gross indicated efficiency of 46.4% with near zero NOx and soot emissions could be achieved using gasoline compression ignition at this load point.

AB A hybrid system is proposed to harvest the waste heat released in MCFC through integrating an absorption refrigerator as a bottoming cycle. A thermo-electrochemical model is used to describe the main irreversible losses in the system. The operating current density interval of the MCFC that enables the bottoming absorption refrigerator to effectively cool is determined. Numerical expressions for the equivalent power output and efficiency are derived to evaluate the performance of the hybrid system under different operating conditions. Compared to the stand-alone MCFC, the maximum power density and the corresponding efficiency of the hybrid system are found to have increased by 3.2% and 3.8%, respectively. The general performance characteristics and optimum operating regions for the hybrid system are revealed. Comprehensive parametric analyses are conducted to investigate how the hybrid system performance depends on various physical properties and working conditions such as working fluid internal irreversibility inside the absorption refrigerator, heat transfer coefficients, some thermodynamic losses related parameters, and the operating current density, temperature and pressure of the MCFC.

AB In this paper, optimization of volume fraction distribution in a thick hollow heterogeneous cylinder subjected to impulsive internal pressure is considered. Dynamic behavior and wave propagation are considered in radial and axial directions. Volume fractions of constituent materials on a finite number of design points are taken as design variables and the volume fractions at any arbitrary point in the cylinder are obtained via cubic spline interpolation functions. The objectives are to minimize the amplitude of stress waves propagating through the structure during a specified time interval, while the total mass of the structure is also minimized. Minimizing the displacement amplitude of the outer surface of the cylinder will also be considered as another objective function. Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm jointed with interior penalty-function method for implementing constraints is effectively employed to find the global solution of the optimization problem. Obtained results indicates that by using the mentioned objective functions, considerably more efficient usage of materials can be achieved compared with the common power law volume fraction distribution. Based on our results, the proposed methodology provides a framework for designing functionally graded structures with optimum material tailoring.

The office is lit by daylight, controlled by an exterior shading system and by artificial light, composed of ceiling sources and a task lamp on each desk. In all, 930 subjects participated in six psychophysical tests conducted on the internet, each dedicated to a user position and an activity. Multiobjective optimizations were then performed with the collected data in order to identify luminous environments that realized the best tradeoffs between visual conditions for both users and power demand. An optimized luminous environment, judged suitable, whatever the combinations of activities in the room, is proposed.

AB In this study, energy absorption characteristics of aluminum nested three -tube structures as one of the types of thin-wall energy absorbers were experimentally and numerically examined and some optimal conditions were presented for such structures. In so doing, after determining the type of alloy and stress strain curves of the tubes, four samples were analyzed under quasi -static collapse. The structures were simulated using finite element software LS-Dyna and the results were compared with data from experimental tests. There was good agreement between experimental and numerical results. After comparing multi-tubular structures with single conventional structures, it was indicated that these structures have a higher capacity to absorb energy. Then, with considering different height and thickness for the structures, the optimal value of these quantities Was determined and it was shown that through optimizing three -tube structures, the maximum collapse force can be as low as possible and energy absorption capacity can be hold high. Finally, by optimizing the results with response surface method using Minitab software, samples with optimal performance in the process of collapse were obtained. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, the design and optimization of a multi-layer configuration of hexagonal metal honeycomb energy absorber is performed using the genetic algorithm. It is assumed that the body structure with a predefined velocity impacts with barrier and the design objectives are to absorb whole kinetic energy besides limiting impact shock force. The response surfaces of honeycomb impact characteristics are extracted using finite element approach and then a honeycomb energy absorber is sized for case of a presumed impact problem. A multi-objective optimization technique is adopted to maximize the energy absorption capacity and to minimize the impact shock level while minimizing the total absorber size. A factorial design of experiment and response surface method is utilized to solve the optimization problem. The geometric specifications of honeycomb panels including the cell size, foil thickness, height and absorber face area for each layer of honeycomb panel are assumed as the design variables. Some optimization problems are handled and the optimized designs are compared to those from the literature wherever available. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Energy plays a key factor in the advancement of humanity. As energy demands are mostly met by fossil fuels, the world-wide consciousness grows about their negative impact on the environment. Therefore, it becomes necessary to design sustainable energy systems by introducing renewable energies. Because of the intermittent availability of different renewable resources, the designing of a sustainable energy system should find an optimal mix of different resources. However, the optimization of this combination has to deal with a number of possibly contradictory objectives.
   Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) are widely used to solve this kind of problems. As optimizing an energy system by using a MOEA is computationally costly, it is necessary to solve the problem efficiently. For this purpose, we propose the incorporation of domain knowledge related to energy systems into different phases (i.e., initialization and mutation) of a MOEA run. The proposed approaches are implemented for two widely used MOEAs and evaluated on the Danish Aalborg test problem. The experimental results show that each approach individually achieves significant improvements of the energy systems, which is expressed in better trade-off sets. Moreover, a state-of-the-art stopping criterion is adapted to detect the convergence in order to save computational resources. Finally, all proposed techniques are merged within two MOEAs with the result that our combined approaches yield significantly better results in less time than generic approaches.

AB JADE and CoDE are two well-known state-of-the-art DE algorithms for solving global optimization problems (GOPs). JADE is found to be suitable for solving unimodal and simple multimodal functions as an exploitation mutation strategy, i.e."DE/current-to-pbest/1", is employed, while CoDE is shown to fit for handling complicated multimodal functions due to its exploration mutation strategies, such as "DE/rand/1 /bin", "DE/currant-to-rand/1", and "DE/rand/2/bin". To combine their merits for tackling different types of GOPs, a novel hybrid framework is designed based on the modified JADE (MJADE) and modified CoDE (MCoDE), named HMJCDE. Different from the simple combination of MJADE and MCoDE, they are operated alternatively according to the improvement rate of the fitness value. To assess the performance of HMJCDE, 30 benchmark problems taken from CEC2014 competition on real parameter optimization are employed. When compared with JADE, CoDE, other state-of-the-art DE variants and non-DE heuristic algorithms, HMJCDE performs better than all the competitors on most of test problems. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis of some parameters in HMJCDE is conducted and the effectiveness of our proposed hybrid framework is also justified experimentally. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB A variety of indicators is available for assessing the economic, environmental, and social aspects of an Eco-industrial park (EIP). The managers of a sustainability assessment over these parks should overcome an important task at the beginning of the study: to select indicators.
   To support this activity, the challenge is to list and classify a large set of sustainability indicators. Consequently, the main achievements of this article are a wide search and classification of sustainability indicators, and the development of four criteria to filter indicators when assessing an EIP. A literature search in ISI Web of Science's database is presented to explore feasible indicators. The definition of 249 indicators is provided in an annotated list.
   An important difficulty to use these indicators is to select a proper subset. To deal with this selection, this work proposes four criteria constructed to be functional, clear, and adaptable to the application context. The proposed criteria are: understanding, pragmatism, relevance, and partial representation of sustainability. The 249 indicators have been filtered using the four criteria, and have been classified according to three dimensions of sustainability (social, environmental, and economic dimensions).
   The four criteria provide a formal way to filter a large set of possible indicators, improving the mechanism for their selection. In order to illustrate their application to select suitable indicators for the assessment of ElPs, a hypothetical case is constructed on the basis of an industrial park in Kalundborg. The selected indicators meet the four criteria and the evaluation goal.
   Focusing on sustainability dimensions, many of the integrated indicators are related to the economic and environmental dimensions. Nevertheless, few of them are related to social dimension. Therefore, to cover the main aspects of each dimension of sustainability, a combination of single and integrated indicators should be included in this assessment.
   Finally, four recommendations are made to select proper indicators during the sustainability assessment of an EIP: start with a large set of possible indicators, as those presented herein, preselect those indicators linked to the objectives of the assessment, apply the four criteria for indicators choice, and prefer comparative indicators.

AB Spent pickling liquors are hazardous waste due to their high concentration of metals and presence of several acids.
   Different processes are developed for treatment of spent pickling liquors aiming to energy efficiency and there are few works in literature about the use of heat pumps (energy efficient and environmentally friendly process) to this purpose. In this article a new process for regeneration of spent pickling liquors producing fertilizers (FeSO4, ZnSO4, FeSO4.center dot 7H(2)O, ZnSO4 center dot 7H(2)O) and integrated with heat pumps is developed. A vapor compression heat pump with indirect expansion is used in evaporation and crystallization section. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to evaluate the effect of heat pump parameters on coefficient of performance. Through response surface a mathematical model is developed for coefficient of performance, CO2 emissions and primary energy consumption. In addition a factorial design allows to evaluate the significance of same factors on them. In this way process parameters and not heat pump parameters are used for factorial design: the integration of heat pumps is more enhanced.
   Results show that overall the two heat pumps, compared to an industrial boiler, allow a reduction of 38% of CO2 emissions and Total Equivalent Warming Impact, reduction of 39% and 57% on tons of equivalent petroleum and costs respectively, according to European Union climate package. Economical incentives in terms of white certificates are obtained so the process is more economically feasible. A Life Cycle Analysis is carried out to evaluate the environmental advantage of heat pumps over the industrial boilers. Results show that the environmental sustainability of all heat pump systems could improve with the greater penetration of renewables in the electricity mix.
   The future construction of the plant will allow to verify the obtained results in order to realize a more accurate mathematical model that optimizes all process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aims to develop a comprehensive decision model for sustainable design of biomass based renewable energy supply chains and district heating systems (DHS) with thermal energy storages. The model integrates the strategic decisions such as location and capacity selection for energy plants, DHS, thermal storages and biomass storages with tactical decisions related to biomass production, supply and transportation planning, inventory management and energy production. The main purpose is to find the optimum configuration of the supply chain and DHS to meet the heat demand of a particular locality. The model combines cost and service level objectives and accounts for biomass supply, material flow, capacity, demand and technical constraints. The problem is formulated as a fuzzy Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that comprises multiple biomass types and system uncertainties. To explore the viability of the proposed model, computational experiments are performed on a real-world case. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to examine the impacts of cost and capacity limit of thermal energy storage, as well as heat demand, on the objective functions and thermal storage capacity. The results reveal that the proposed model can effectively be used in practice to assist the decision makers in planning energy production systems in a sustainable and effective manner.

AB In this paper, we propose a joint model of feature selection and ensemble learning for anaphora resolution in the resource-poor environment like the Indian languages. The proposed approach is based on multi-objective differential evolution (DE) that optimises five coreference resolution scorers, namely Muc, BCUB, CEAFM, CEAFE and BLANC. The main goal is to determine the best combination of different mention classifiers and the most relevant set of features for anaphora resolution. The proposed method is evaluated for three leading Indian languages, namely Hindi, Bengali and Tamil. Experiments on the benchmark datasets of ICON-2011 Shared Task on Anaphora Resolution in Indian Languages show that our proposed approach attains good level of accuracies, which are often better with respect to the state-of-the-art systems. It achieves the F-measure values of 71.89%, 59.61%, 52.55% 34.45% and 72.52% for Muc, BCUB, CEAFM, CEAFE and BLANc, respectively, for Bengali language. For Hindi we obtain the F-measure values of 33.27%, 63.06%, 49.59%, 49.06% and 55.45% for Muc, Bcun, CEAFM, CEAFE and BLANC metrics, respectively. In order to further show the efficacy of our proposed algorithm, we evaluate with Tamil, a language that belongs to a different family. This shows the F-measure values of 31.79%, 64.67%, 46.81%, 45.29% and 52.80% for Muc, BCUB, CEAFM, CEAFE and BLANC metrics, respectively. Experiments on Dutch show the F-measure values of 17.67%, 74.43%, 58.08%, 59.21% and 55.58% for Muc, BCUB, CEAFM, CEAFE and BLANC metrics, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm (CCEA) decomposes a problem into several subcomponents and optimizes them separately. This divide-and-conquer feature endows CCEAs with the capability of distributed and high-efficiency problem solving. However, traditional CCEAs trend to converge to Nash equilibrium rather than the global optimum due to information loss accompanied with problem decomposition. Moreover, the interactive nature makes the subcomponents' landscapes dynamic, which increases the challenge to conduct global optimization. To address these problems, a multi-population mechanism based CCEA (mCCEA) was proposed to compensate information in dynamic landscapes. The mCCEA is decentralized for each subcomponent since it doesn't need centralized archive or information sharing. It focuses on both the global and the local optima of each subcomponent by maintaining multiple populations and conducting local search in dynamic landscapes. These optima are seen as the current representatives of the subcomponents and used by the other subcomponents to construct their complete solutions for fitness evaluation. Experimental study was conducted based on a wide range of benchmark functions. The performance of the proposed algorithm was compared with several peer algorithms from the literature. The experimental results show effectiveness and advantage of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays, cardiovascular diseases are very common and are one of the main causes of death worldwide. One major type of such diseases is the coronary artery disease (CAD). The best and most accurate method for the diagnosis of CAD is angiography, which has significant complications and costs. Researchers are, therefore, seeking novel modalities for CAD diagnosis via data mining methods. To that end, several algorithms and datasets have been developed. However, a few studies have considered the stenosis of each major coronary artery separately. We attempted to achieve a high rate of accuracy in the diagnosis of the stenosis of each major coronary artery. Analytical methods were used to investigate the importance of features on artery stenosis. Further, a proposed classification model was built to predict each artery status in new visitors. To further enhance the models, a proposed feature selection method was employed to select more discriminative feature subsets for each artery. According to the experiments, accuracy rates of 86.14%, 83.17%, and 83.50% were achieved for the diagnosis of the stenosis of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, left circumflex (LCX) artery and right coronary artery (RCA), respectively. To the best of our knowledge, these are the highest accuracy rates that have been obtained in the literature so far. In addition, a number of rules with high confidence were introduced for deciding whether the arteries were stenotic or not. Also, we applied the proposed method on two challenging datasets and obtained the best accuracy in comparison with other methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a modified TLBO (teaching-learning-based optimization) approach for the local linear radial basis function neural network (LLRBFNN) model to classify multiple power signal disturbances. Cumulative sum average filter has been designed for localization and feature extraction of multiple power signal disturbances. The extracted features are fed as inputs to the modified TLBO-based LLRBFNN for classification. The performance of the proposed modified TLBO-based LLRBFNN model is compared with the conventional model in terms of convergence speed and classification accuracy. Also, an extreme learning machine (ELM) approach is used to optimize the performance of the proposed LLRBFNN and is compared with the TLBO method in classifying the multiple power signal disturbances. The classification results reveal that although the TLBO approach produces slightly better accuracy in comparison with the ELM approach, the latter is much faster in implementation, thus making it suitable for processing large quantum of power signal disturbance data.

AB Although substantial numbers of aerodynamic shape optimization works have been carried out in the past few decades, the effects of boundary layer transition are not considered in the overwhelmingly majority of those previous studies. For more accurate prediction of the flow field, and for exploration of relations between aerodynamic heating and geometrical features, the commonly used local correlation-based transition model -Ret is implemented into a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver. A CFD-based multiobjective shape optimization method is then described and applied to a hypersonic lifting body in this paper. For parametric modeling and grid deformation, the flexible free form deformation and robust transfinite interpolation techniques are used respectively. The response surface model is adopted as the approximation model for the reduction of computational cost, and the multiobjective genetic algorithm is employed for the exploration of optimal solutions. Optimization processes have been conducted by the optimization toolkit DAKOTA and two Pareto fronts are obtained. Besides, typical solutions on the Pareto fronts are compared and analyzed. The results obtained from the case considered in this study indicate that the lift-to-drag ratio and transition onset position are closely related with the volume of the vehicle, and trade-off can be made for aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic performance from the optimal solutions. Moreover, the design problem of lifting body demonstrates the robustness and practicality of the new optimization procedures, which incorporates the transition phenomenon for hypersonic flow.

AB Direct energy balance (DEB) coordinated control scheme is widely used by field engineers in coal-fired power plants while attracting little attention in the academic community. This paper aims to derive a mathematical model that is suitable for DEB research. To balante the model's fidelity and simplicity, the power plant is divided into three transformation modules and, using conservation laws, a dynamic model is developed to describe each module. Within reasonable assumptions, numerous module equations are combined to yield a 6th-order nonlinear model. Time constants of the model are identified based on Pareto optimization. Model accuracy is confirmed using field measurements from a 300 MW coal-fired power plant. Based on the linearized model, the merits of the DEB control structure are analyzed. It is confirmed that the DEB control is sufficient to fulfill the fundamental goals of power plant regulation. An illustration of performance improvement is given by introducing gain scheduling techniques to the DEB structure. The proposed model can provide groundwork for future development of advanced control algorithms under the DEB structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The single family home market is facing increasing challenges in managing environmental issues. The required objective of building energy performance can be achieved by limiting extra cost, integrating building design, and using the most appropriate and readily available materials. However, standard computations, such as the French building energy code used here, require vocational expertise that involves managing separate processes and numerous design variables. The design is therefore restricted to well-known techniques, especially for small constructions. In this paper, the usual stakeholder constraints and possible developments in design practice are considered through the use of real product databases and vocational tools to calculate construction costs. In the first stage, which takes into account cost and energy demand, an integrated approach to building envelope design is detailed, including a semantic system to automate the process. Then an optimization method (a genetic algorithm) is proposed to assess energy performance and the cost of the building envelope. This process is illustrated as a case study for a single family house. The results highlight various optimal solution domains specific to the case study, which can be further managed through a decision support system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An efficient reanalysis assisted optimization method is proposed for variable-stiffness composite design. The contour lines of functions can be used to describe fiber paths by using newly developed path functions. The parameters of path functions are used as design variables, and the initial objective function is evaluated by using Finite Element Method (FEM). The variable-stiffness composite laminate is formulated using FEM based on Mindlin shell theory. Manufacturing constraints are considered by examining the curvature and parallelism of fiber paths, therefore, the optimal solutions should be manufacturable. In order to improve the efficiency of optimization, reanalysis methods are employed instead of popular surrogate models. Compared with the Surrogate Assisted Optimization (SAO), the advantage of reanalysis is that the error can be well controlled, thus the accuracy of optimization should be improved significantly. Two numerical examples are used to verify the performance of the proposed method. The comparison with the linear variation fiber orientation angles shows that the proposed method obtains better solutions by considering the manufacturing constraints simultaneously.

AB This paper proposes a generalized control method for battery-driven switched reluctance motor (SRM) drives based on integrated multiport power converter (IMPC) with small-ripple bidirectional power flow ability in electric vehicles. Large power ripple caused by the current commutation is a challenge issue for SRM drives, which would lower the system efficiency, requires extra heat dissipation in the battery and shortens its lifetime. The detailed model of the SRM drive and IMPC is developed which covers both motoring and generating modes of operation. Based on this model, an advanced multiobjective power flow control method with repetitive controller is proposed to restrain battery current ripple. Because of the unified model, a seamless transition between various modes can also be achieved. Finally, simulation and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and superior performance of the proposed control method.

AB This study investigates the control system design and its small-signal properties for the output stage of a high-bandwidth four-quadrant three-phase switch-mode controllable AC voltage source (CVS) with an output power of 10 kW, a switching frequency of 48 kHz, and a two-stage LC output filter. Each output phase of the CVS is operated individually, i.e., the phase voltages are generated with reference to the DC input-voltage midpoint, to allow maximum flexibility in the generation of the output-voltage waveforms to supply a wide range of different load types, such as DC, single-phase, and general three-phase loads including constant-power loads leading to negative small-signal load-resistance values. Three suitable multiloop control structures with inner-current-and outer-voltage-control loops are motivated, modeled, and are optimized with respect to different control performance indicators, e.g., small-signal control bandwidth, and for common boundary conditions, e.g., maximum overshoot of the output voltage in case of a reference voltage step. All structures employ conventional P and PI controllers, due to their simplicity and widespread use. Among the three structures, the capacitor-current feedback-control structure, which controls the two filter capacitor currents and the output voltage, is identified to be most competitive. The small-signal bandwidth determined for this structure is between 7.1 kHz and 15.5 kHz, depending on the value of the load resistance. This result, in combination with an excellent matching of calculated and measured step responses of the output voltage of a 10 kW hardware prototype, point out the effectiveness of the selected control structure and the usability of control structures that are composed of conventional P and PI controllers.

AB Process modeling and simulation are essential to predict process energetic demands, and determine possible throughputs and process emissions in biorefineries. In this paper non-linear multiobjective optimization studies with conflicting process and environmental objectives are performed in a sugarcane biorefinery. The process produces bioethanol (first and second generation), bioelectricity and concentrates vinasse in multiple-effect evaporators. Objective functions, concerning process and environmental issues, are defined and studied in five optimization problems. Decision variables are fraction of bagasse diverted to E2G production (Var1), and the fraction of vinasse that is concentrated up to 7.0 degrees Bx in multiple-effect evaporator (Var2). The results show that Varl cannot assume values greater than circa 0.5, due to thermal demands of the integrated process, while Var2 cannot be lower than 0.15, due to process demands for vegetal steam. Flows of concentrated vinasse are generally higher when maximization of bioethanol throughputs is imposed. When electric power generation and bioethanol throughput maximization are the objectives, the former varies 45.6%, while the latter varies 16.6%, among non-dominated solutions. The adopted approach can be used as a decision-making tool that may help to choose suitable operating conditions, in order to obtain a trade-off between greater profits and a more sustainable process.

AB We devote this paper to study a class of interval valued multiobjective programming problems. For this we consider two order relations LU and LS on the set of all closed intervals and propose many concepts of Pareto optimal solutions. Based on convexity concepts (viz. LU and LS-convexity) and generalized differentiability (viz. gH-differentiability) of interval valued functions, the KKT optimality conditions for aforesaid problems are obtained. In addition, we compare our results with the results given in Wu (2009) and we show some advantages of our results. The theoretical development is illustrated by suitable examples.

AB We consider robust stochastic optimization problems for risk-averse decision makers, where there is ambiguity about both the decision maker's risk preferences and the underlying probability distribution. We propose and analyze a robust optimization problem that accounts for both types of ambiguity. First, we derive a duality theory for this problem class and identify random utility functions as the Lagrange multipliers. Second, we turn to the computational aspects of this problem. We show how to evaluate our robust optimization problem exactly in some special cases, and then we consider some tractable relaxations for the general case. Finally, we apply our model to both the newsvendor and portfolio optimization problems and discuss its implications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The ongoing rapid expansion of the Word Wide Web (WWW) greatly increases the information of effective transmission from heterogeneous individuals to various systems. Extensive research for information diffusion is introduced by a broad range of communities including social and computer scientists, physicists, and interdisciplinary researchers. Despite substantial theoretical and empirical studies, unification and comparison of different theories and approaches are lacking, which impedes further advances. In this article, we review recent developments in information diffusion and discuss the major challenges. We compare and evaluate available models and algorithms to respectively investigate their physical roles and optimization designs. Potential impacts and future directions are discussed. We emphasize that information diffusion has great scientific depth and combines diverse research fields which makes it interesting for physicists as well as interdisciplinary researchers.

AB Xylobiose (X2), which is currently available from xylooligosaccharides (XOS), has been reported to have outstanding prebiotic function and to be highly suitable for application in food industries. This has sparked an interest in the economical production of X2 of high purity (> 99%) in food and prebiotic industries. To address such issue, we developed a highly-efficient chromatographic method for the recovery of X2 from XOS with high purity and high recovery. As a first step for this work, an eligible adsorbent for a large-scale separation between X2 and other XOS components was selected. For the selected adsorbent, a single column experiment was carried out to determine the intrinsic parameters of all the XOS components, which were then used in the optimal design of the continuous X2-recovery process based on a simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatographic method. Finally, the performance of the designed X2-recovery SMB process was verified by the relevant SMB experiments, which confirmed that the developed process in this study could recover X2 from XOS with the purity of 99.5% and the recovery of 92.3% on a continuous separation mode. The results of this study will be useful in enabling the economical production of high purity X2 on a large scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present the results of multiobjective genetic algorithm optimizations of a single-shot ultrafast electron diffraction beam line utilizing a 225 kV dc gun with a novel cryocooled photocathode system and buncher cavity. Optimizations of the transverse projected emittance as a function of bunch charge are presented and discussed in terms of the scaling laws derived in the charge saturation limit. Additionally, optimization of the transverse coherence length as a function of final rms bunch length at the sample location have been performed for three different sample radii: 50, 100, and 200 mu m, for two final bunch charges: 10(5) electrons (16 fC) and 10(6) electrons (160 fC). Example optimal solutions are analyzed, and the effects of disordered induced heating estimated. In particular, a relative coherence length of L-c,L-x/sigma(x) = 0.27 nm/mu m was obtained for a final bunch charge of 105 electrons and final bunch length of sigma(t) approximate to 100 fs. For a final charge of 10(6) electrons the cryogun produces L-c,L-x/sigma(x) approximate to 0.1 nm/mu m for sigma(t) approximate to 100-200 fs and sigma(x) >= 50 mu m. These results demonstrate the viability of using genetic algorithms in the design and operation of ultrafast electron diffraction beam lines.

AB This work presents and generalizes our experience in the use of fuzzy set theory, including its combination with another branch of mathematics of uncertainty, in developing general approaches and methods for optimization and decision making with considering the uncertainty and multicriteria factors in problems of the design, planning, operation, and control of complex systems. Two major classes of situations that require the use of a multicriteria approach are identified. In accordance with this, two general classes of models related to multiobjective (< X, F > models) and multiattribute (< X, R > models) problems, respectively, are considered. Methods for their analysis based on the use of the Bellman-Zadeh approach to decision making in a fuzzy environment and fuzzy preference modeling techniques, respectively, are considered. Although, the use of < X, F > and (X, R > models is of an independent character, they also serve as parts of a general scheme for multicriteria decision making under conditions of uncertainty. This scheme is associated with the use of a generalization of the classic approach to considering the uncertainty of information to multicriteria problems, based on analyzing special aggregations of payoff matrices. The authors' experience in the use of the results indicated above for solving diverse classes of power system planning and operation problems is described. This experience convincingly demonstrates diverse advantages of applying fuzzy mathematics in optimization and decision making problems of power engineering. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB This study investigates adaptive neural network (NN) state feedback control and robust observation for an active suspension system that considers parametric uncertainties, road disturbances and actuator saturation. An adaptive radial basis function neural network is adopted to approximate uncertain non-linear functions in the dynamic system. An auxiliary system is designed and presented to deal with the effects of actuator saturation. In addition, since it is difficult to obtain accurate states in practice, an NN observer is developed to provide state estimation using the measured input and output data of the system. The state observer-based feedback control parameters with saturated inputs are optimised by the particle swarm optimisation scheme. Furthermore, the uniformly ultimately boundedness of all the closed-loop signals is guaranteed through rigorous Lyapunov analysis. The simulation results further demonstrate that the proposed controller can effectively suppress car body vibrations and offers superior control performance despite the existence of non-linear dynamics and control input constraints.

AB Ecological performance of a single resonance ESE heat engine with heat leakage is conducted by applying finite time thermodynamics. By introducing Nielsen function and numerical calculations, expressions about power output, efficiency, entropy generation rate and ecological objective function are derived; relationships between ecological objective function and power output, between ecological objective function and efficiency as well as between power output and efficiency are demonstrated; influences of system parameters of heat leakage, boundary energy and resonance width on the optimal performances are investigated in detail; a specific range of boundary energy is given as a compromise to make ESE heat engine system work at optimal operation regions. Comparing performance characteristics with different optimization objective functions, the significance of selecting ecological objective function as the design objective is clarified specifically: when changing the design objective from maximum power output into maximum ecological objective function, the improvement of efficiency is 4.56%, while the power output drop is only 2.68%; when changing the design objective from maximum efficiency to maximum ecological objective function, the improvement of power output is 229.13%, and the efficiency drop is only 13.53%.

There are many articles published on the optimization of energy systems, which use a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for different cases. However a general method for optimization results utilization in design process is not presented to the authors' knowledge and usually equilibrium point concept is used to select the optimal solution. Here a new method is proposed to improve the optimization results utilization in the design process. This method is applied on a simple energy system to consider the correlations between the design parameter and objective functions. The proposed method is flexible and easy to implement in any design problem. Results provide a neat process of optimum design includes cost limited maximum efficiency and components parameters selection like the condenser pressure and sub cool and superheat degrees. Results also show that compressor efficiency is the most powerful parameter in the case, which has the most significance effects on the optimization results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB With increasing the penetration of wind power, the voltage regulation becomes a more important problem in active distribution networks. In addition, as an uncertain load Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) will introduce a new concern in voltage adjustment of future distribution networks. Hence, this paper presents a flexible active-reactive power based Wind Distributed Generation (WDG) planning procedure to address the mentioned challenges. The uncertainties related to WDG5, load demand as well as PEV5 load have been handled using the Point Estimate Method (PEM). The distribution network under study is equipped to on-loadtap-changer and, as a conventional voltage control component, the Capacitor Banks (CBs) will be planned simultaneously with WDGs. The planning procedure has been considered as a two-loop optimization problem that is solved using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Tabu Search (TS) algorithms. The tap position and power factor of WDGs are taken into account as stochastic variables with practical limitations. The proposed methodology is applied to a typical distribution network and several scenarios are considered and analyzed. Simulation results show that the standard deviation of power factor depends on PEVs penetration that highlights the capability curve of WDG5. The optimal penetration of wind power increases nonlinearly versus increasing of PEV5 connected to the distribution network, however the fixed CBs are required to increase the optimal penetration of WDGs. The proposed Modified PSO (MPSO) is compared with the conventional PSO in numerical studies that show MPSO is more efficient than the conventional algorithm for this analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study utilizes computational topology optimization methods for the systematic design of optimal multifunctional silicon anode structures for lithium-ion batteries. In order to develop next generation high performance lithium-ion batteries, key design challenges relating to the silicon anode structure must be addressed, namely the lithiation-induced mechanical degradation and the low intrinsic electrical conductivity of silicon. As such this work considers two design objectives, the first being minimum compliance under design dependent volume expansion, and the second maximum electrical conduction through the structure, both of which are subject to a constraint on material volume. Density-based topology optimization methods are employed in conjunction with regularization techniques, a continuation scheme, and mathematical programming methods. The objectives are first considered individually, during which the influence of the minimum structural feature size and prescribed volume fraction are investigated. The methodology is subsequently extended to a bi-objective formulation to simultaneously address both the structural and conduction design criteria. The weighted sum method is used to derive the Pareto fronts, which demonstrate a clear trade-off between the competing design objectives. A rigid frame structure was found to be an excellent compromise between the structural and conduction design criteria, providing both the required structural rigidity and direct conduction pathways. The developments and results presented in this work provide a foundation for the informed design and development of silicon anode structures for high performance lithium-ion batteries.

AB End-of-pipe permitting is a widely practised approach to control effluent discharges from wastewater treatment plants. However, the effectiveness of the traditional regulation paradigm is being challenged by increasingly complex environmental issues, ever growing public expectations on water quality and pressures to reduce operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions. To minimise overall environmental impacts from urban wastewater treatment, an operational strategy-based permitting approach is proposed and a four-step decision framework is established: 1) define performance indicators to represent stakeholders' interests, 2) optimise operational strategies of urban wastewater systems in accordance to the indicators, 3) screen high performance solutions, and 4) derive permits of operational strategies of the wastewater treatment plant. Results from a case study show that operational cost, variability of wastewater treatment efficiency and environmental risk can be simultaneously reduced by at least 7%, 70% and 78% respectively using an optimal integrated operational strategy compared to the baseline scenario. However, trade-offs exist between the objectives thus highlighting the need of expansion of the prevailing wastewater management paradigm beyond the narrow focus on effluent water quality of wastewater treatment plants. Rather, systems thinking should be embraced by integrated control of all forms of urban wastewater discharges and coordinated regulation of environmental risk and treatment cost effectiveness. It is also demonstrated through the case study that permitting operational strategies could yield more environmentally protective solutions without entailing more cost than the conventional end-of-pipe permitting approach. The proposed four-step permitting framework builds on the latest computational techniques (e.g. integrated modelling, multi-objective optimisation, visual analytics) to efficiently optimise and interactively identify high performance solutions. It could facilitate transparent decision making on water quality management as stakeholders are involved in the entire process and their interests are explicitly evaluated using quantitative metrics and trade-offs considered in the decision making process. We conclude that the operational strategy-based permitting shows promising for regulators and water service providers alike. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, the static output-feedback control problem of active suspension systems with information structure constraints is investigated. In order to simultaneously improve the ride comfort and stability, a half car model is used. Other constraints such as suspension deflection, actuator saturation, and controller constrained information are also considered. A novel static output-feedback design method based on the variable substitution is employed in the controller design. A single-step linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization problem is solved to derive the initial feasible solution with a sparsity constraint. The initial infeasibility issue of the static output-feedback is resolved by using state-feedback information. Specifically, an optimization algorithm is proposed to search for less conservative results based on the feasible controller gain matrix. Finally, the validity of the designed controller for different road profiles is illustrated through numerical examples. The simulation results indicate that the optimized static output feedback controller can achieve better suspension performances when compared with the feasible static output-feedback controller.

AB Tender analysis processes are everyday processes in any company, but they become even more important when the financial resources are limited. Achieving optimal and transparent tender analysis processes requires hard work from everyone involved. This paper proposes a linguistic multi-criteria decision-making model which helps decision-makers in this task by automating it. To do that, the proposal requires diverse experts to assess different criteria and establish their corresponding weights. The processing of all these input data will determine a minimum value, called profile, to consider an alternative as valid. Additionally, assessments of a similar (probably external) process will be taken into account, becoming a reference valuation. Unlike other decision-making models, the use of this last value gives an idea of the goodness of the result depending on whether the solution obtained is close to the reference value. To the best of our knowledge, there is no expert or intelligent system specifically designed to fully meet the needs of tender analysis processes. For both input and output process stages carried out in our proposal, 2-tuple linguistic labels have been used. These linguistic labels were chosen to facilitate decision-making for the staff involved in the process, as well as for being the most suitable communication way used by human beings. To validate the model, we apply it to a case study in the ICT (Information and Communications Technology) sector. In addition, we include a literature review related to applications using the 2-tuple representation, as well as a comparison of our proposal with related methods, including the results obtained by these methods for the case study presented.

AB Australia's mining sector periodically suffered huge losses both directly and indirectly from mismanagement of mine water during extreme climatic events. Mine water managers still lack cost-effective tools and strategies to manage both climate-influenced drought and flooding challenges. This paper aims to answer a fundamental question in mine water management: how much can a water sharing approach do to reduce unpermitted (unregulated) mine-affected water to overflow to the environment on a regional scale? To this end, we built a climate-driven hierarchical systems model (C-HSM) of sixteen coal mines in the Bowen Basin of Queensland, Australia. The C-HSM simulated the dynamics of the mine water systems, which was then the basis to assess the potential of mine water sharing to reduce unregulated discharge. We found that mine water sharing could greatly cut down regional unregulated discharge during the 2010-2011 wet season (which included an extreme flooding event). The cost of building such a regional-scale sharing infrastructure for redistributing water was found to be competitive to the lost revenue due to reduced coal production. The capital cost could potentially be further reduced by using existing water pipelines such as those used for coal seam gas water management or considering cheap transporting options. Once the sharing infrastructure has been installed, it can prevent periodic suffering of mines from climate extremes. Combined with an actively regulated discharge strategy, the water sharing approach could almost completely eliminate the unregulated discharge and maintain mine water storages at a secure level. The capital and operational cost for the combined approach can be considerably reduced and the shared water could be stored at other sites (mines, water holding ponds from coal seam gas industry) and used for water-limited periods.
   This is the first work that explores the theoretical potential of mine water sharing to mitigate the risk of unregulated discharge. The work presented here reveals that mine water sharing could help mine water managers respond to a sudden change in extremes such as switching from extreme 'dry' to extreme 'wet' conditions. A combined mine water sharing strategy would be worth considering by mine water managers, due to its advantages in regards to safety, relatively lower implementation costs, its effectiveness of reducing unregulated discharge that may cause environmental harm and conserving excess water for future water-limited periods. The ultimate value of water savings through a sharing scheme may be considerable as it influences mining industry's social license-to-operate in the long term, especially under conditions where there is a water security issue of decreasing availability and increasing competition. The work also highlights the benefits of systems modeling in supporting mine water managers with strategic decision making. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper deals with the analysis of human arm movement in a crank-rotation task that is an example of environmentally constrained movements. Opening a door, rotating a steering wheel, and pushing a carriage are other typical examples of movements where the physical constraints, imposed on the hand position/orientation, influence the joint angles of the shoulder and the elbow. To predict kinematic and kinetic patterns for human arm movement in crank-rotation tasks, we use an optimization-based technique. The method enables dynamic prediction of closed-chain movements and force exertion using inverse dynamics musculoskeletal simulation. An anatomically detailed musculoskeletal model is parameterized by means of time functions controlling selected degrees-of-freedom. Subsequently, the parameters of these functions are optimized to produce an optimal motion according to a user-defined objective function and constraints given by the anthropometry of the body and physics of the environment. In this study, we use a physiology-based objective function expressing the muscle metabolic energy expenditure and validation metrics to assess the accuracy of the computational model. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons between predicted results and experimental data from a group of four healthy males indicate that the method reproduces natural kinetic and kinematic patterns.

AB Constructal optimization of the whole cylindrical pin-fin heat sinks (PFHS) is performed by the finite volume method (FVM). Maximum dimensionless heat transfer rate (MDHTR) is taken as the objective for fixed total heat sink volume and fin-material volume, and pressure drop is used to evaluate the hydraulic performance of the system. Variation of the dimensionless heat transfer rate (DHTR) and its corresponding pressure drop along the diameter of cylindrical pin-fin is studied, and the influences of the volume fraction and fluid velocity on the results are analyzed, and the flow field and temperature distribution of PFHS are shown. The results show that there exists an optimal diameter which corresponds to an optimal number of pin fins makes the DHTR maximized when the shape of PFHS is fixed, the MDHTR and its corresponding pressure drop and optimal constructs are different for different volume fraction; there exists an optimal aspect ratio of the PFHS which makes the MDHTR maximization. The sensitivity of heat transfer performance to the fin-material fraction is higher than hydraulic performance does, but with respect to the fluid velocity and the aspect ratio of PFHS, the sensitivity of hydraulic performance is higher. The results of this paper can provide theoretical support for the optimization design of cylindrical PFHS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, a mathematical optimization procedure was used to improve the gas exchange process of a single-cylinder compression ignition naturally aspirated engine. Duct lengths and valve timing were chosen as optimization variables while volumetric efficiency was defined as the objective function. Calculations were carried out using a parallelized computational code consisting of (i) a one-dimensional model for the unsteady compressible gas flow taking place in intake and exhaust ducts; (ii) a single-zone combustion model for the in-cylinder processes; and (iii) an optimization routine based on the Differential Evolution technique. Three sets of optimization calculations were conducted. In the first one, the intake duct length was the only optimization variable and it was found that optimal inlet duct lengths vary becoming shorter as engine speed is increased. In the second set of calculations, both intake and exhaust duct lengths have been taken as the optimization variables, and the resulting optimal intake duct lengths were quite similar to those of the first set. In addition, optimal exhaust duct lengths resulted very close in value to optimal intake duct lengths, except at the highest speeds, when the decreasing tendency as engine speed is raised was supplanted by the opposite tendency. In the third set of calculations, the crank angles defining valve synchronism were the optimization variables. It was found that optimal valve timing produced a gain in volumetric efficiency, which is similar to that obtained with optimal duct lengths. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a multi objective method for optimal network reconfiguration as well as reactive power dispatches of distributed generations (DGs) has been proposed to improve the network performances by using non-dominated sorting particle swarm optimisation. The various network performances in terms of multi objective function include minimisation of system power loss, voltage deviation and energy wastage from solar and wind generation system. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been tested on the IEEE 33-bus radial distribution system for different combinations of network reconfiguration and reactive power output of DGs or its varying power factor. The obtained results also compared and indicated that better network performances achieved with both network reconfiguration and power factor optimisation over other cases. In addition, this strategy also results in lesser energy wastage from distributed renewable generation over without network reconfiguration option; hence, this approach is also suitable for saving and utilising maximum capacity of available renewable sources.

AB We report new Rosetta-based approaches to tackling the major issues that confound protein structure refinement, and the testing of these approaches in the CASP11 experiment. Automated refinement protocols were developed that integrate a range of sampling methods using parallel computation and multiobjective optimization. In CASP11, we used a more aggressive large-scale structure rebuilding approach for poor starting models, and a less aggressive local rebuilding plus core refinement approach for starting models likely to be closer to the native structure. The more incorrectly modeled a structure was predicted to be, the more it was allowed to vary during refinement. The CASP11 experiment revealed strengths and weaknesses of the approaches: the high-resolution strategy incorporating local rebuilding with core refinement consistently improved starting structures, while the low-resolution strategy incorporating the reconstruction of large parts of the structures improved starting models in some cases but often considerably worsened them, largely because of model selection issues. Overall, the results suggest the high-resolution refinement protocol is a promising method orthogonal to other approaches, while the low-resolution refinement method clearly requires further development.

Each alternative refers to how an oil field, known and defined, is put into production, that is, with respect to the determination of number and the disposition of producers wells and injectors in the field. The implementation of the algorithm is to find the production settings, in the long run, which provide the highest net present value (VPL), obtained from the initial investment cost, the price of oil, oil production and operation costs paid during the production time, thus increasing the production of oil in the field, reducing operating costs and the time in the decision-making process.

AB Through analyzing the integrated oil and gas production process, a multi-objective optimization model for the integrated oil and gas production process is established through considering nonlinear reservoir behaviour, multiphase flow in wells, and constraints from the surface facilities. In order to reduce the influence of model parameter uncertainty in the oil and gas production process, an error compensation method based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is proposed to compensate the model. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is used as the optimization algorithm. Moreover, an operational strategy using post optimizationis applied to solve the optimization model, so as to ensure the feasibility of the obtained optimal set-point. Finally, a novel optimization approach for the oil and gas production process considering model parameter uncertainty is proposed. Simulation results indicate that the proposed optimization method is feasible and effective.

AB A hybrid technique for solving the congestion management problem in an electricity market based on harmony search algorithm (HAS) and Fuzzy mechanism is presented in this article. This algorithm does not require initial value setting for the variables and does not require differential gradients, thus it can consider discontinuous functions as well as continuous functions. The HAS is a recently developed powerful evolutionary algorithm, inspired by the improvisation process of musicians, for solving single/multiobjective optimization problems. In the proposed technique, each musician plays a note for finding a best harmony all together. Transmission pricing and congestion management are the key elements of a competitive electricity market based on direct access. They also focus of much of the debate concerning alternative approaches to the market design and the implementation of a common carrier electricity system. This article focuses on the tradeoffs between simplicity and economic efficiency in meeting the objectives of a transmission pricing and congestion management scheme. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is applied on 30 and 118 bus IEEE standard power system in comparison with CPSO, PSO-TVAC, and PSO-TVIW. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed technique is better and superior than other compared methods. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Metaheuristic techniques have been applied to this problem and can help software developers when they face contradictory goals. We show how the knowledge and experience of human experts can be enriched by these techniques, with the idea of obtaining a better requirements selection than that produced by expert judgment alone. This objective is achieved by embedding metaheuristics techniques into a requirements management tool that takes advantage of them during the execution of the development stages of any software development project.

AB A method of differential evolution (DE) integrated with artificial neural networks (ANN) is derived for modelling and optimization of a biosurfactant process producing rhamnolipid by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A central composite rotatable design (CCRD) data is used to develop multiple regression and ANN response surface models in order to integrate them with DE for optimizing the medium compositions. The DE with global search operators explores the search space of the response surface models and finds the optimum medium compositions that maximize the rhamnolipid productivity. A multiobjective simultaneous optimization strategy that integrates ANN model with DE search is found to compromise for biomass concentration and maximize the rhamnolipid activity as 55.9 mg/L (R-2 = 0.914) with an optimized medium compositions of glucose=24.079; NH4NO3=3.28; KH2PO4=0.24; yeast extract=7.95 and MgSO4.7H(2)O=2.69. The experimental rhamnolipid activity of 56 mg/L obtained using the optimized medium compositions are close to the predicted rhamnolipid activity. These findings demonstrate that the ANN-DE integrated multi objective optimization strategy is quite effective for simultaneous optimization of biochemical and biotechnological processes.

AB In gas production from methane-hydrate (MH) reservoirs, consolidation induces invasion of the reservoir, and the gravel pack may be replaced by the invading sand. Therefore, the gravel pack of an MH reservoir must have a high shear strength and a higher permeability than the reservoir. In this study, we investigated the shear strength and permeability of different particles, with the gravel aspect ratio as the design variable. Particles with aspect ratios of 1,1.5, 2, and 2.5 were packed under isotropic compression using discrete-element method (DEM) simulations. Particles with an aspect ratio of 1.5 exhibited the lowest void ratio. Shear strength was measured using triaxial compression DEM simulations, with the 2.5 aspect ratio particles exhibiting the highest value. Permeability was evaluated using pore scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of the particle pack generated by the DEM. Particles with an aspect ratio of 2.5 exhibited the highest permeability. The performance of the four types of particles was compared using multiobjective optimization, with shear strength and permeability as the objective functions. Particles with an aspect ratio of 2.5 exhibited the highest performance against both objective functions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Metal matrix composites (MMCs) as advanced materials, while producing the components with high dimensional accuracy and intricate shapes, are more complex and cost effective for machining than conventional alloys. It is due to the presence of discontinuously distributed hard ceramic with the MMCs and involvement of a large number of machining control variables. However, determination of optimal machining conditions helps the process engineer to make the process efficient and effective. In the present investigation a novel hybrid multi-response optimization approach is proposed to derive the economic machining conditions for MMCs. This hybrid approach integrates the concepts of grey relational analysis (GRA), principal component analysis (PCA) and Taguchi method (TM) to derive the optimal machining conditions. The machining experiments are planned to machine Al7075/SiCp MMCs using wire-electrical discharge machining (WEDM) process. SiC particulate size and its weight percentage are explicitly considered here as the process variables along with the WEDM input variables. The derived optimal process responses are confirmed by the experimental validation tests and the results showed satisfactory. The practical possibility of the derived optimal machining conditions is also analyzed and presented using scanning electron microscope examinations. According to the growing industrial need of making high performance, low cost components, this investigation provide a simple and sequential approach to enhance the WEDM performance while machining MMCs.

ID OPTIMIZATION; QUALITY
AB The hypervolume subset selection problem consists of finding a subset, with a given cardinality k, of a set of nondominated points that maximizes the hypervolume indicator. This problem arises in selection procedures of evolutionary algorithms for multiobjective optimization, for which practically efficient algorithms are required. In this article, two new formulations are provided for the two-dimensional variant of this problem. The first is a (linear) integer programming formulation that can be solved by solving its linear programming relaxation. The second formulation is a k-link shortest path formulation on a special digraph with the Monge property that can be solved by dynamic programming in O(k(n - k) + n log n) time. This improves upon the result of O(n(2)k) in Bader (2009), and slightly improves upon the result of O(nk + n log n) in Bringmann et al. (2014b), which was developed independently from this work using different techniques. Numerical results are shown for several values of n and k.

ID MULTIOBJECTIVE EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; OPTIMIZATION
AB Given a nondominated point set X subset of R-d of size n and a suitable reference point r is an element of R-d, the Hypervolume Subset Selection Problem (HSSP) consists of finding a subset of size k <= n that maximizes the hypervolume indicator. It arises in connection with multiobjective selection and archiving strategies, as well as Pareto-front approximation postprocessing for visualization and/or interaction with a decision maker. Efficient algorithms to solve the HSSP are available only for the 2-dimensional case, achieving a time complexity of O(n(k + log n)). In contrast, the best upper bound available for d > 2 is O(n(d/2) log n + n(n-k)). Since the hypervolume indicator is a monotone submodular function, the HSSP can be approximated to a factor of (1 - 1/e) using a greedy strategy. In this article, greedy O(n(k + log n))-time algorithms for the HSSP in 2 and 3 dimensions are proposed, matching the complexity of current exact algorithms for the 2-dimensional case, and considerably improving upon recent complexity results for this approximation problem.

AB A considerable fraction of urban water supply capacity serves primarily as a hedge against drought. Water utilities can reduce their dependence on firm capacity and forestall the development of new supplies using short-term drought management actions, such as conservation and transfers. Nevertheless, new supplies will often be needed, especially as demands rise due to population growth and economic development. Planning decisions regarding when and how to integrate new supply projects are fundamentally shaped by the way in which short-term adaptive drought management strategies are employed. To date, the challenges posed by long-term infrastructure sequencing and adaptive short-term drought management are treated independently, neglecting important feedbacks between planning and management actions. This work contributes a risk-based framework that uses continuously updating risk-of-failure (ROF) triggers to capture the feedbacks between short-term drought management actions (e.g., conservation and water transfers) and the selection and sequencing of a set of regional supply infrastructure options over the long term. Probabilistic regional water supply pathways are discovered for four water utilities in the Research Triangle region of North Carolina. Furthermore, this study distinguishes the status-quo planning path of independent action (encompassing utility-specific conservation and new supply infrastructure only) from two cooperative formulations: weak cooperation, which combines utility-specific conservation and infrastructure development with regional transfers, and strong cooperation, which also includes jointly developed regional infrastructure to support transfers. Results suggest that strong cooperation aids utilities in meeting their individual objectives at substantially lower costs and with less overall development. These benefits demonstrate how an adaptive, rule-based decision framework can coordinate integrated solutions that would not be identified using more traditional optimization methods.

AB This paper deals with multiobjective analog circuit optimization taking into consideration performance sensitivity vis-a-vis parameters' variations. It mainly considers improving computation time of the inloop optimization approaches by including sensitivity considerations in the Pareto front generation process, not as a constraint, but by involving it within the used metaheuristic evolution process. Different approaches are proposed and compared. NSGA-II metaheuristic is considered. The proposed sensitivity aware approaches are showcased via two analog circuits, namely, a second generation CMOS current conveyor and a CMOS voltage follower. We show that the proposed ideas considerably alleviate the long computation time of the process and improve the quality of the generated front, as well. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a new design of a grounded active inductor (AI) with an improved topology based on Manetakis regulated cascode active inductor comprising of three control voltages for tunability. An additional pMOST was introduced in the design as a drain load at the output of nMOST source follower. The aim of this work is to design a CMOS AI at Ku band using AIDA-C, a state-of-the-art multi-objective multi constraint circuit-level optimization tool. Firstly, a reasonable AI operating at Ku band was manually designed using a 130 nm technology. This circuit and its design variables were fed to AIDA-C as an element of the initial population. Then the sizing of the proposed AI MOSTs was optimized. AIDA-C circuit sizing tool is able to achieve not only one but a set of solutions for the AI exhibiting high quality factor at a predefined Ku band operating frequency. This set of alternative Pareto optimal solutions enables the designer to choose the most suitable circuit sizing for a given application. AI's main performance parameters in terms of s parameters (s(11)), quality factor (Q), inductance value (L), linearity, noise figure, power consumption and tunability based on control and biasing voltages are presented. Layout of the optimized AI is also presented. This AI was used to design active filters. Their selectivity, insertion losses and noise analysis is presented and discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Genetic algorithms (GAs) are perhaps the oldest and most frequently used search techniques for dealing with complex and intricate real-life problems that are otherwise difficult to solve by the traditional methods. The present article provides an extensive literature review of the application of GA on supply chain management (SCM). SCM consists of several intricate processes and each process is equally important for maintaining a successful supply chain. In this paper, eight processes (where each process has a set of sub-processes) as given by Council of SCM Professionals (CSCMF) are considered. The idea is to review the application of GA on these aspects and to provide the readers a detailed study in this area. The authors have considered more than 220 papers covering a span of nearly two decades for this study. The analysis is shown in detail with the help of graphs and tables. It is expected that such an extensive study will encourage and motivate the fellow researchers working in related area; to identify the gaps and to come up with innovative ideas.

AB This paper focuses on the study of optimality conditions and duality in nonsmooth fractional multiobjective optimization problems. Applying some advanced tools of variational analysis and generalized differentiation, we establish necessary optimality conditions for (weakly) efficient solutions of a fractional multiobjective optimization problem involving inequality and equality constraints. Sufficient optimality conditions for such solutions to the considered problem are also obtained by means of (strictly) generalized convex-affine functions. In addition, we address a dual problem to the primal one and examine duality relations between them.

AB We develop an interactive algorithm for biobjective integer programs that finds the most preferred solution of a decision maker whose preferences are consistent with a quasiconvex preference function to be minimized. During the algorithm, preference information is elicited from the decision maker. Based on this preference information and the properties of the underlying quasiconvex preference function, the algorithm reduces the search region and converges to the most preferred solution progressively. Finding the most preferred solution requires searching both supported and unsupported nondominated points, where the latter is harder. We develop theory to further restrict the region where unsupported nondominated points may lie. We demonstrate the algorithm on the generalized biobjective traveling salesperson problem where there are multiple efficient edges between node pairs and show its performance on a number of randomly generated instances.

AB Although strategic and operational uncertainties differ in their significance of impact, a "one-size-fits-all" approach has been typically used to tackle all types of uncertainty in the optimal design and operations of supply chains. In this work, we propose a stochastic robust optimization model that handles multi-scale uncertainties in a holistic framework, aiming to optimize the expected economic performance while ensuring the robustness of operations. Stochastic programming and robust optimization approaches are integrated in a nested manner to reflect the decision maker's different levels of conservativeness toward strategic and operational uncertainties. The resulting multi-level mixed-integer linear programming model is solved by a decomposition-based column-and-constraint generation algorithm. To illustrate the application, a county-level case study on optimal design and operations of a spatially-explicit biofuel supply chain in Illinois is presented, which demonstrates the advantages and flexibility of the proposed modeling framework and efficiency of the solution algorithm.

AB With growing interest in the biomass value chain, a multitude of reactions are proposed in literature for the conversion of biomass into a variety of biofuels. In the early design stage, data for a detailed design is scarce rendering an in-depth analysis of all possibilities challenging. In this contribution, the screening methodology process network flux analysis (PNFA) is introduced assessing systematically the cost and energy performance of processing pathways. Based on the limited data available, a ranking of biorefinery pathways and a detection of bottlenecks is achieved by considering the reaction performance as well as the feasibility and energy demand of various separation strategies using thermodynamic sound shortcut models. PNFA is applied to a network of six gasoline biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass. While 2-butanol is ruled out due to a lack in yield and selectivity, iso-butanol and 2-butanone are identified as economically promising fuels beyond ethanol.

AB It is shown that finding the equivalence set for solving multiobjective discrete optimization problems is advantageous over finding the set of Pareto optimal decisions. An example of a set of key parameters characterizing the economic efficiency of a commercial firm is proposed, and a mathematical model of its activities is constructed. In contrast to the classical problem of finding the maximum profit for any business, this study deals with a multiobjective optimization problem. A method for solving inverse multiobjective problems in a multidimensional pseudometric space is proposed for finding the best project of firm's activities. The solution of a particular problem of this type is presented.

AB Flow allocation problem is one of the important steps in reliability evaluation or optimization of a stochastic flow network. In a single source single sink networks it is easy to determine the flow on each path by using one of best known methods. While, in the case of multisource multisink flow network the flow allocation problem becomes more complicated and few studies have dealt with it. This paper investigates the flow allocation problem of multisource multisink stochastic flow network with assuming that there are several sorts of resource flows transmitting through that network with unreliable nodes. The mathematical formulation of the problem is modified to increase the efficiency of obtaining optimal solutions that satisfy all constraints. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed to solve the flow allocation problem in existing multisource multisink networks such that the reliability of the system capacity vector is maximized. The results obtained for test cases are compared with other proposed methods to show that the proposed algorithm is efficient in obtaining optimal solutions that satisfy, all constraints, and it achieves a maximum value of reliability of the system capacity vector. Finally, the proposed GA has employed to optimize the system reliability of multisource multisink stochastic flow networks.

This MIG can be operated in Ku/Ka/Q single band or Ku-Ka/Ka-Q dual band. The optimization of the MIG is accomplished by a multiobjective genetic algorithm method. It is anticipated that this MIG possesses an axial velocity spread of <5% in all the operating frequency bands. The results of sensitivity study show that this MIG can work stably within reasonable parametric windows. Velocity spreads considering cathode surface roughness and initial thermal temperature are analyzed. Cathode configuration with heat insulation chambers is introduced to cut off the thermal flow among the emitters. Thermal analysis has been performed.

As for electrical drives, torque density, acoustic noise, and torque ripple are of primary concern. This paper describes the influence of the pole numbers on the radial forces and the cogging torques. We show how continuous and discrete skewing can suppress torque harmonics effectively. Further, we investigated different simulation modes for magnetic gears using finite-element software. A multiobjective optimization was conducted to find a Pareto-optimal magnetic gear, whose cogging torque was minimized by skewing one rotor. Finally, we present a prototype with a gear ratio of 1:21, and compare finite-element resultswith the measurements of unskewed and skewed magnetic gears.

SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING

ID DRUG DISCOVERY; METRICS; CHEMISTRY
AB The triage of compounds at the Single: concentration screening phase of high-throughput screening (HTS) requires multiobjective optimization in order to achieve the best selection of hits, both in terms of potency and physicochemical properties, for a given number of compounds to test. In this regard, ligand efficiency indexes, well established as guides for hit prioritization in the close response phase of HTS, are less studied in the single.: concentration phase. In the present work the use of ligand efficiency indexes in the prioritization of compounds in single concentration is investigated. Formulas for deriving them from single-concentration screening data are provided. The statistical association between the single-concentration and dose response ligand efficiency indexes is evaluated with a wide historical data set including multiple screens of different target classes and screening technologies. The results show Pearson's correlation coefficients r above 0.9 for compounds with dose response curves, and areas under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves above 0.85 after including compounds with no dose-response curves: This good statistical association contains the contribution of both. the physicochemical parameter(s) in the ligand efficiency indexes, as well as the biological activity, as demonstrated by permutation tests. The "cost/benefit" of using different thresholds of single-concentration ligand efficiency indexes in rescuing different numbers of efficient compounds is systematically investigated, and cost/benefit curves are provided. Approximate :thresholds are proposed for the different ligand efficiency parameters that results in large percentages of efficient compounds rescued while attempting to reduce the cost of compounds to test in dose response mode. Finally, a practical example of implementation of these indexes that considers clustering of compounds is described, where the rescue of efficient compounds is higher and with a much lower cost than a typical response-driven selection.

AB This paper presents an optimal kinetostatic design method for a general 3PRS (Prismatic-revolute-spherical) spatial parallel manipulator by formulating a multi-objective optimization problem considering the performance indices are as the objective functions. Three performance criteria-Global conditioning index (GCI), Global stiffness index (GSI) and workspace volume-were formulated and the effect of actuator layout angle on the performance indices was studied. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on the Control elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (CENSGA) was adopted to find the final approximation set. The optimal geometric parameters that yield minimal compliance with larger workspace volume and improved dexterity are suggested for a general 3PRS parallel manipulator. For the optimal design, it is shown that global isotropy and global stiffness of the platform is improved at the cost of workspace reduction.

TI OPTIMAL ASSET ALLOCATION IN LIFE INSURANCE: THE IMPACT OF REGULATION

AB In a typical equity-linked life insurance contract, the insurance company is entitled to a share of return surpluses as compensation for the return guarantee granted to the policyholders. The set of possible contract terms might, however, be restricted by a regulatory default constraint - a fact that can force the two parties to initiate sub-optimal insurance contracts. We show that this effect can be mitigated if regulatory policy is more flexible. We suggest that the regulator implement a traffic light system where companies are forced to reduce the riskiness of their asset allocation in distress. In a utility-based framework, we show that the introduction of such a system can increase the benefits of the policyholder without deteriorating the benefits of the insurance company. At the same time, default probabilities (and thus solvency capital requirements) can be reduced.

AB The Closed loop Supply chain network distribution is one of the most important problems with much real world application in supply chain management area. Presently climate change problem is one of the major concerns for Researchers. Closed loop green supply chain (GCLSC) problem is the extension of closed loop supply chain problem. Semiconductor industries are one of the major industries and a number of waste products in semiconductor industries are quite high. We have considered reducing the waste in semiconductor by recycling the useful waste electronic equipment. In GCLSC, we consider to maximize the profit in forward supply chain whereas we attempt to minimize the Carbon footprints at the same time. In this paper we used a hybrid of Estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) and Territory Defined multi-objective algorithm to select the optimum number of facilities in the closed loop supply chain network. To examine the effectiveness of our Hybrid Territory Defined algorithm (EDATDEA), we compare the results with those obtained by NSGA II on a same GCLSC problem with different problem sizes and the same data sets.

AB This paper presents the development of a collaborative optimization framework in combination with a variable-complexity modeling technique for the multidisciplinary coupling analysis and design of a shrouded turbine blade. The multidisciplinary optimization design of the shrouded turbine blade involves a high-fidelity detailed computational model and medium-fidelity models, which can become prohibitively expensive. In this investigation, a variable-complexity modeling methodology is introduced, where low-fidelity models and a scaling function are used to approximate the medium-and high-fidelity models through the optimizers in an inner-loop optimization to reduce computational expense. The optimization framework developed includes the collaborative optimization process, parametric modeling of the shrouded turbine blade, fluid-structure interaction solver using arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation, an adaptive hexahedral structure mesh generator by establishing virtual blocks and parametric fixed points, and a variable-complexity modeling method combining the multiplicative and additive corrections to manage three levels of fidelity models. On the shrouded turbine-blade design problem, it achieves a feasible optimizer only calling nine high-fidelity analyses. Response surface model variation and cross-validation tests are performed to verify the predictive power of the response surface model in the multidisciplinary design optimization process of the shrouded turbine blade.

AB This work presents some energy considerations concerning a biorefinery case study that has been carried out by the CRB/CIRIAF of the University of Perugia. The biorefinery is the case study of the BIT3G project, a national funded research project, and it uses the lignocellulosic biomass that is available in the territory as input materials for biochemical purposes, such as cardoon and carthamus. The whole plant is composed of several sections: the cardoon and carthamus seed milling, the oil refinement facilities, and the production section of some high quality biochemicals, i.e., bio-oils and fatty acids. The main goal of the research is to demonstrate energy autonomy of the latter section of the biorefinery, while only recovering energy from the residues resulting from the collection of the biomass. To this aim, this work presents the quantification of the energy requirements to be supplied to the considered biorefinery section, the mass flow, and the energy and chemical characterization of the biomass. Afterwards, some sustainability strategies have been qualitatively investigated in order to identify the best one to be used in this case study; the combined heat and power (CHP) technology. Two scenarios have been defined and presented: the first with 6 MWt thermal input and 1.2 MWe electrical power as an output and the second with 9 MWt thermal input and 1.8MWe electrical power as an output. The first scenario showed that 11,000 tons of residual biomass could ensure the annual production of about 34,000 MWht, equal to about the 72% of the requirements, and about 9600 MWhe, equal to approximately 60% of the electricity demand. The second scenario showed that 18,000 tons of the residual biomass could ensure the total annual production of about 56,000 MWht, corresponding to more than 100% of the requirements, and about 14,400 MWhe, equal to approximately 90% of the electricity demand. In addition, the CO2 emissions from the energy valorization section have been quantified and the possibility of re-using the CO2 flow in order to produce methane is described.

AB For maintenance and quality assurance during the execution of manufacturing processes, it is necessary to use careful experimental procedures to ensure customer satisfaction and high competitive standards in the market. This paper, which focuses on the class of non-destructive testing, proposes an optimization methodology for the alternating current pulsed gas metal arc welding (P-GMAW) process. The methodology is based on the numerical characterization of electrical signals of current and voltage by processing the obtained digital signals. The numerical characterization is performed by calculating the area under the curve of the electrical signals, which were then used to estimate the indicator difference relative percentage (DRP) of the signs of the experimental design for an experiment taken as a reference. Among the results, the study finds that the proposed method shows better results for signs composed of all its original wave frequencies at the expense of analysis performed on signals reconstructed from its three largest original wave frequencies. The results of the optimizations also showed more variability among themselves. In addition to the optimization analysis, the efficacy was evaluated in a T2 Hotelling control chart as a tool for control. Additionally, due to its application in multivariate processes, this study also analyzes the DRPs of electrical signals using statistical process monitoring.

AB This paper focused on the analysis of imprecise information in terms of many critical parameters for a multi-objective multi-item vendor selection-order allocation problem with price-breaks. We used both quantitative and qualitative criteria taking into account the economic, technological, social, environmental factors, and the price-breaks that were offered on order quantity following 'all-unit discount schedule.' We developed an optimization model that integrated fuzzy multi-objective integer linear programming and analytic hierarchy process techniques. A weighted possibilistic programming approach was presented to solve the optimization model, which simultaneously minimized (maximized) the best scenario, the likeliest scenario, and the worst scenario for the imprecise objective functions thereby avoiding situations that may force the solution process to divert. The integrated model and the solution approach were tested on the data set of an industrial case study. A detailed performance analysis and comparisons were done to show superiority of the proposed methodology over the existing related fuzzy programming approaches.

AB In this paper, a methodology approach based on analysis of multidimensional Pareto front is proposed. A new optimization approach helps the user to set the optimal parameters of a machining process. Four neural networks are used to model desire output responses, and they are used as objective functions. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to find the best parameters that improve process. As application of approached proposed, an analysis of a multidimensional Pareto front is made considering a minimization of time, temperature, vibration, and surface roughness in a milling process of Ti64 alloy. Physical parameters for experimental approach are tool diameter, number of cutting edge of the tool, cutting speed, feed, and depth of cut. Analysing the 2D and 3D multidimensional Pareto front is generated a user table of machining parameters.

In the present study, output power and engine thermal efficiency are maximized via employing the NSGA-II approach and thermodynamic analysis. The multi-objective evolutionary approach on the basis of the NSGA-II method is implemented throughout this work for optimizing the above-mentioned variables. To evaluate the aforementioned goal, two objective functions which comprises the power output (W) and cycle efficiency (eta) have been included in the optimization process simultaneously.

AB The effects of thermocouples physical size on the performance of a thermoelectric heat pump (TEH) driven by a thermoelectric generator (TEG) device are investigated in this article. The physical size refers to the length and the cross-sectional area of the thermocouples. The performance analysis is multiobjective, including stable electrical current, heating load, coefficient of performance, maximum heating load and maximum heating temperature difference. A characteristic parameter, i.e. area-length ratio, is defined to describe the thermocouples physical size. The influences of the parameter are analyzed by detailed numerical examples. A practical example is proposed to show how to select appropriate thermoelectric modules (TEMs) to construct a high-performance TEG-TEH system satisfying different requirements. The results show that an improvement in its performance is possible by optimizing internal physical size of thermocouples. The conclusion obtained could be used for the selection of TEMs and the design of the TEG-TEH system.
