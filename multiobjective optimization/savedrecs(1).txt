AB Challenges like scalability and visualization which make multi-objective optimization algorithms unsuitable for solving many-objective optimization problems, are often handled using objective reduction approaches. This work proposes a novel many-objective optimization algorithm, viz. Differential Evolution using Clustering based Objective Reduction (DECOR). Correlation distance based clustering of objectives from the approximated Paretofront, followed by elimination of all but the centroid constituent of the most compact cluster (with special care to singleton cluster), yields the reduced objective set. During optimization, the objective set periodically toggles between full and reduced size to ensure both global and local exploration. For finer clustering, number of clusters is eventually increased until it is equal to the remaining number of objectives. DECOR is integrated with an Improved Differential Evolution for Multi-objective Optimization (IDEMO) algorithm which uses a novel elitist selection and ranking strategy to solve many-objective optimization problems. DECOR is applied on some DTLZ problems for 10 and 20 objectives which demonstrates its superior performance in terms of convergence and equivalence in terms of diversity as compared to other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. The results have also been statistically validated. Source code of DECOR is available at http://decor.droppages.comfindex.html. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes a robust control method for power sharing among dispatchable electronically coupled distributed energy resources (DERs) in an autonomous microgrid. The DER units operate in parallel to meet the total aggregated load demand. The aggregated load is assumed to be uncertain, unbalanced and/or nonlinear, thus it is considered as a source of unmodeled dynamics. The main objective of this paper is to design an H-infinity robust controller to enable tracking reference commands of the voltages at the output of the DERs in the presence of unmodeled dynamics. In addition, the H-infinity control design problem is combined with other control methods, such as constrained optimal control and regional pole placement, to achieve an optimal control objective, and to improve transient response. The optimal controller is achieved by minimizing an upper bound on H-2 performance. The regional pole placement is achieved by defining a linear matrix inequalities (LMI) region. This multiobjective H-2/H-infinity problem, combined with regional pole placement are expressed as a set of LMIs, and solved by using standard convex optimization algorithms. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method in maintaining the desired voltage at the DER outputs, in presence of unbalanced and nonlinear loads, simulation results are provided for a single DER unit, and the performance of the proposed control strategy is compared with three different controller strategies. Power sharing among multi DER units in autonomous networks is then demonstrated through digital time-domain simulation studies using MATLAB/SimPowerSystems Toolbox. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In recent years, hospitals have increasingly been faced with a growing proportion of their inpatient work coming from the fluctuating and unpredictable demand of emergency admissions. The opportunity to move emergency patients who have been selected for admission out of the emergency department (ED) is linked to the ability of the hospital network to actually admit them. The latter is, in turn, correlated to the availability of inpatient beds in the hospital wards, which are shared resources between elective and emergency patients. Due to the overcrowding of EDs and the growing concern regarding reducing the number of inpatient ward beds, it is thus becoming crucial to improve the bed capacity planning and the management of emergency and elective patient admissions. In this direction, greater coordination and communication among the different healthcare providers involved in the pathway flows is required, and the so-called "bed management" function plays a key role. This study starts with collaboration with the local health government (LHG) of the Liguria region aimed at studying the hospital bed management function. A large quantity of data records have been collected during one year of activity to obtain information related to the flow of emergency and elective patient pathways. A medium-sized hospital located in the city of Genova has been chosen as a case study, and a discrete event simulation model has been developed to reproduce the multiple patient flows involved in the system. Multiobjective optimization analysis has been performed to choose the best bed allocations considering both operational and tactical decisions characterized by various trade-offs among alternative conflicting objectives. The model can be used to help decision makers find a representative set of Pareto-optimal solutions and quantify trade-offs when satisfying different objectives.

AB Selecting a suitable set of beam angles is an important but difficult task in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for cancer treatment. From a single objective point of view, this problem, known as the beam angle optimization (BAO) problem, is solved by finding a beam angle configuration (BAC) that leads to the best dose distribution, according to some objective function. As there exists a trade-off between the main goals in IMRT (to irradiate the tumor according to some prescription and to avoid surrounding healthy tissue), it makes sense to solve this problem from a multiobjective (MO) point of view. When doing so, a solution of the BAO problem is no longer a single BAC, but instead a set of BACs that lead to a set of dose distributions that, depending on both dose prescription and physician preferences, can be selected as the preferred treatment. We solve thisMOproblem using a two-phase strategy. During the first phase, a deterministic local search algorithm is used for selecting a set of locally optimal BACs, according to a single-objective function. During this search, an optimal dose distribution for each BAC, with respect to the single-objective function, is calculated using an exact nonlinear programming algorithm. During the second phase, a set of nondominated points is generated for each promising locally optimal BAC and a dominance analysis among them is performed. The output of the procedure is a set of (approximately) efficient BACs that lead to good dose distributions. To demonstrate the viability of the method, the two-phase strategy is applied to a prostate case.

AB Cutting of sheet material is considered as an important process due to its relevance among products of everyday life such as aircrafts, ships, cars, furniture etc. Among various sheet cutting processes (ASCPs), laser beam cutting is one of the most capable ASCP to create complex geometries with stringent design requirements in difficult-to-cut sheet materials. Based on the recent research work in the area of sheet cutting, it is found that the Nd-YAG laser is used for cutting of sheet material in general and reflective sheet material in particular. This paper reviews the experimental analysis of Nd-YAG laser cutting process, carried out to study the influence of laser cutting parameters on the process performance index. The significance of experimental modeling and different optimization approaches employed by various researchers has also been discussed in this study. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB By the growing usage of geothermal energy as an alternative approach to produce useful work such as electricity, the emission of global greenhouse gases could be reduced because of its environmentally friendly. In this paper, the thermodynamic and economic performances of three systems which contain a basic Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), a Regenerative Organic Rankine Cycle (RORC) and a Two-Stage Evaporation Organic Rankine Cycle (TSEORC) are investigated in order to generate electrical power from geothermal sources. For operating the considered cycles, three types of pure organic working fluids including dry (R600a, R601a), wet (R152a and R134a) and isentropic (R11 and R123) ones are selected. Firstly, according to thermodynamic aspect, Peng Robinson (PR) and Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) equations of state are used to determine thermodynamic properties of mentioned working fluids and geothermal water, respectively. Furthermore, the operating parameters involving evaporator and regenerative temperatures, degree of superheat and pinch point temperature difference in evaporator are optimized with three optimization methods. Objective functions are exergy efficiency, Specific Investment Cost (SIC) and a combination of exergy and SIC for thermodynamic, economic and exergoeconomic optimizations. The amount of boundary conditions constituting of heat source inlet temperature, heat sink inlet temperature, heat source inlet pressure, heat sink inlet pressure temperature of condenser, pinch point temperature in condenser and heat source mass flow rate are 423.14 (K), 293.15 (K), 5 (bar), 2 (bar), 308 (K), 5 (K) and 50 (kg/s) respectively. Optimizations results show that among all considered operating parameters, degree of superheat ranged between 0 and 20 is the most effective parameter which is almost obtained at lower, upper and in the middle range of optimization bounds in the thermodynamic, economic and exergoeconomic investigations respectively. Secondly, from economic view point, three economic indicators: Levelized Cost Of Electricity (LCOE), Return On Investment (ROI) and Payback Period (PBP) are utilized so as to focus on the economic performance of three mentioned ORC configurations based on exergoeconomic results for twenty countries with geothermal resources as well as different cost of electricity production and tax rates. The results indicate that Australia has the maximum amount of ROI making up a bit more than 100% and minimum amount of PBP accounting for lower than four years when R123 is applied as the working fluid in TSEORC system. Also, the maximum and minimum values of LCOE are obtained in basic ORC-R134a and RORC-R123 (0.1474 and 0.0493 respectively). In addition, the investigation of impact of operating parameters on economic indicators for Iran illustrate that the ROI value dramatically rise by increasing the evaporator temperature and degree of superheat. In contrast, pinch point temperature difference leads to a decline in the amount of ROI. This note should be taken in to account that ROI and PBP show the reverse results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Water allocation is facing profound challenges due to climate change uncertainties. To identify adaptive water allocation strategies that are robust to climate change uncertainties, a model framework combining many-objective robust decision making and biophysical modeling is developed for large rivers. The framework was applied to the Pearl River basin (PRB), China where sufficient flow to the delta is required to reduce saltwater intrusion in the dry season. Before identifying and assessing robust water allocation plans for the future, the performance of ten state-of-the-art MOEAs (multi-objective evolutionary algorithms) is evaluated for the water allocation problem in the PRB. The Borg multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (Borg MOEA), which is a self-adaptive optimization algorithm, has the best performance during the historical periods. Therefore it is selected to generate new water allocation plans for the future (2079-2099). This study shows that robust decision making using carefully selected MOEAs can help limit saltwater intrusion in the Pearl River Delta. However, the framework could perform poorly due to larger than expected climate change impacts on water availability. Results also show that subjective design choices from the researchers and/or water managers could potentially affect the ability of the model framework, and cause the most robust water allocation plans to fail under future climate change. Developing robust allocation plans in a river basin suffering from increasing water shortage requires the researchers and water managers to well characterize future climate change of the study regions and vulnerabilities of their tools.

AB The problem of layup optimization of the composite laminates involves a very complex multidimensional solution space which is usually non-exhaustively explored using different heuristic computational methods such as genetic algorithms (GA). To ensure the convergence to the global optimum of the applied heuristic during the optimization process it is necessary to evaluate a lot of layup configurations. As a consequence the analysis of an individual layup configuration should be fast enough to maintain the convergence time range to an acceptable level. On the other hand the mechanical behavior analysis of composite laminates for any geometry and boundary condition is very convoluted and is performed by computational expensive numerical tools such as finite element analysis (FEA). In this respect some studies propose very fast FEA models used in layup optimization. However, the lower bound of the execution time of FEA models is determined by the global linear system solving which in some complex applications can be unacceptable. Moreover, in some situation it may be highly preferred to decrease the optimization time with the cost of a small reduction in the analysis accuracy. In this paper we explore some machine learning techniques in order to estimate the failure of a layup configuration. The estimated response can be qualitative (the configuration fails or not) or quantitative (the value of the failure factor). The procedure consists of generating a population of random observations (configurations) spread across solution space and evaluating using a FEA model. The machine learning method is then trained using this population and the trained model is then used to estimate failure in the optimization process. The results obtained are very promising as illustrated with an example where the misclassification rate of the qualitative response is smaller than 2%.

AB Application architectures in the cloud employ elastic components, and achieve lower operating costs without sacrificing quality. Software architects strive to provide efficient services by deciding on software topology: a set of structural architectural decisions. For a given application, there can be numerous software topology alternatives creating the need for automated optimization methods. Current optimization approaches rely on experts providing application performance models built upfront, based on their experience and the requirements provided. While such techniques are effective and valuable, they require additional maintenance effort as the software evolves.
   This paper introduces ElaClo, a framework for optimizing application topologies in a cloud environment. ElaClo's main contribution is in providing optimization in the software assembly phase from automatically extracted application models. ElaClo provides workload generation, monitoring, topology management, elasticity mechanisms, and algorithms to support the optimization process. We have implemented ElaClo as an expert tool and evaluated it on a real-life cloud application from the retailing business do Main. ElaClo was used to select optimal topologies with regards to service response time objectives and infrastructure costs. The efficiency of the optimization process and the quality of optimization results were validated quantitatively on a set of optimization runs. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested framework in yielding optimal topologies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In seeking constraints on global climate model projections under global warming, one commonly finds that different subsets of models perform well under different objective functions, and these trade-offs are difficult to weigh. Here a multiobjective approach is applied to a large set of subensembles generated from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 ensemble. We use observations and reanalyses to constrain tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures, upper level zonal winds in the midlatitude Pacific, and California precipitation. An evolutionary algorithm identifies the set of Pareto-optimal subensembles across these three measures, and these subensembles are used to constrain end-of-century California wet season precipitation change. This methodology narrows the range of projections throughout California, increasing confidence in estimates of positive mean precipitation change. Finally, we show how this technique complements and generalizes emergent constraint approaches for restricting uncertainty in end-of-century projections within multimodel ensembles using multiple criteria for observational constraints.

AB A jet pump used in the thermoacoustic engine can improve the performance by suppressing the Gedeon streaming. In this paper, response surface methodology (RSM) and desirability approach are used to investigate and optimize the jet pump in a thermoacoustic Stirling heat engine (TASHE). The position, length, diameter and tapered angle of jet pump are selected as the designing parameters, and pressure amplitude and time-averaged power dissipation across the jet pump are adopted as responses. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) is conducted to identify the significant influences of jet pump's parameters on responses. The regression models are obtained, and prediction deviations for pressure amplitude and power dissipation are within +/- 2% and +/- 5% respectively. In addition, the influences of jet pump's parameters on responses are plotted by 3D surface. Eventually, the designing parameters of jet pump are optimized to achieve both maximal pressure amplitude and minimal power dissipation. The optimal results are validated by comparing with DeltaEC simulation. Results show that the deviations between DeltaEC and RSM for pressure amplitude and power dissipation are 1.86% and 2.88%, which indicates that RSM as an assessment methodology in optimizing jet pump is feasible.

AB The aim of this paper is twofold. First, to find Pareto solutions for minimization of the heat-transfer area and pumping power to solve a shell-and-tube heat exchanger multiobjective optimization problem using the Predator-Prey, Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization, and Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II evolutionary algorithms. Each algorithm's performance is analyzed using the following statistical metrics: Hypervolume, Spacing and Pair-wise Distance. Second, to use the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations decision-making method to choose the best evolutionary algorithms. The criteria used in decision making are the statistical metrics and the annual cost heat exchanger operation. The results show the Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization as the most robust algorithm during decision making. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB One of highly promising ways for fucose production is to utilize the defatted residue of microalgae as the fucose source. A prerequisite for such fucose-production strategy is a robust separation process that can perform an efficient recovery of fucose in a monosugar mixture coming from the hydrolysis of the defatted microalgal biomass. To develop such process, we first selected a prospective large-scale adsorbent that had a sufficiently high selectivity between fucose and other monosugar components. The selected adsorbent was then experimented in accordance with the principle of multiple frontal analysis in order to obtain the intrinsic parameters of the relevant monosugar components. Using the resultant parameters, the optimal design of the fucose-separation process of interest was carried out on the basis of a simulated moving bed (SMB) technology. The validity of the designed process was investigated first with detailed model simulation, and then with a continuous fucose-separation experiment based on the self-assembled SMB equipment. The results of the SMB experiment demonstrated that the developed process was highly effective in continuous separation of fucose with the purity of 97.1% while maintaining its loss as low as 0%. It is thus expected that the results in this study can contribute to a meaningful improvement in the economical efficiencies of both a microalgae based biodiesel-production process and a fucose-production process.

In this study, it is proposed to simultaneously consider the efficient use of energy resources when high shares of DG are procured through the ANM approach. To that end, a multi-period and multiobjective optimisation algorithm, based on the linearised optimal power flow, is formulated. The algorithm seeks to maximise the installed capacity of DG while minimising the energy losses and consumption of voltage-dependent loads. The objectives are optimised considering the coordinated operation of voltage regulators and on-load tap changers, and the management of DG generation curtailment and reactive power compensation from DG. Additionally, the effects of load and generation uncertainties are addressed through a two-stage stochastic programming formulation of the multiobjective problem. The result is a set of non-inferior solutions, which allows exploring the degree of conflict among the objectives. The proposed approach was tested on two IEEE test feeders and the solutions show a significant improvement in the system's energy efficiency with a low impact on the amount of connected DG.

AB This study compares fractional order phase lead-lag controller, fractional order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID), and tilt-integral-derivative controllers as thyristor controlled series capacitor (TCSC)-based damping controller to improve load frequency control (LFC) performance in a restructured power system. To prepare an efficient ancillary service, a precise formulation for participation of TCSC in tie-line power flow exchange is presented which is compared with the earlier Taylor-based approximated model. The controller parameters are adjusted by employing different evolutionary algorithms. To obtain realistic results under a competitive environment, a diverse-GENCOs multi-DISCOs power system with the generation rate constraint and governor dead-band effects, communication time delay, bilateral contracts, and pool-co transactions is taken into account. Non-linear time-domain simulations demonstrate that the FOPID-based TCSC damping controller in coordination with an integral-type simple LFC can most effectively suppress the area frequency and tie-line power oscillations. Further investigations are performed for uncontracted higher order step and random load demands treated as contract violation scenarios to confirm the superiority of the proposed fractional order controllers-based TCSC-LFC over the Taylor-based TCSC-LFC. The sensitivity analysis is done for a wide range of loading condition and system parameters to compare the robustness of the considered controllers.

AB In order to recover the waste heat produced in molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs), a new hybrid system mainly consisting of an MCFC, a thermoelectric generator, and a thermoelectric cooler is integrated for performance enhancement. The irreversible losses in each subsystem are fully considered. The relationship between the dimensionless electric current of the thermoelectric element and the electric current density of the MCFC is discussed in detail. Based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the analytical formulas for power density and efficiency of the hybrid system are specified under different operation conditions. The general performance characteristics of the hybrid system are revealed and the optimum regions for several parameters are given. Numerical calculations show that the power density and efficiency of the hybrid system are 3.4% and 4.0% larger than that of the stand-alone MCFC, respectively. The effects of some main operating and design parameters on the performance of the proposed system are discussed through parametric analyses. Abundant numerical calculation examples are provided to show how to improve the system performance. The results obtained may provide some theoretical bases for the MCFC performance improvement through heat management method. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In order to improve the catalytic activity, the screening of optimal potential additives to Ni/Al2O3 catalysts for CO methanation was performed by data mining techniques with a combination of principal component analysis, K-means algorithm and Gaussian process regression (GPR). Based on a tremendous amount of data from previous studies, 63 elements excluding gaseous, poisonous and radioactive ones were selected as initial candidates. After the screening by element clustering, the activities of Ni/Al2O3 catalysts promoted by 9 representative elements including Na, Ca, Cr, B, La, Ru, Cu, Zn, and In were measured, and the catalytic activity was analyzed in terms of T-50, which represents the temperature at a CO conversion rate of 50%. The activities and physicochemical properties of the nine elements were used to construct regression models by GPR. The regression models predicted that as a potential additive, Re promotes the activity; we experimentally verified that the T50 dropped by 78 degrees C relative to that of the unmodified Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. It can be considered to be the most effective one of all additives. The advantages of using data mining techniques in catalyst research are that they reduce the number of catalysts to be empirically analyzed and they accelerate the discovery of new catalysts.

AB Hybrid energy systems have provided a promising way to realize nearly/net zero energy buildings (nZEB) including isolated buildings in remote areas and grid-connected buildings. This study aims to investigate and compare several typical hybrid energy systems (HESs) for designing grid-connected nearly/net zero energy buildings (nZEB). Specially, an exhaustive searching method and Monte Carlo simulation are utilized to optimize hybrid energy systems for Hong Kong Zero Carbon Building considering uncertainty impacts. The performance of nearly/net zero energy buildings is evaluated in terms of a combined performance comprised of the cost, CO2 emissions and grid interaction index. Subsequently, the effects of design mismatch ratio, weighting factor combination and the probability to be nZEB on the performance are analyzed and compared under the four hybrid energy systems. The study results show that the probability for a building to achieve annual energy balance is highly depending on the design mismatch ratio, and the correlative dependencies between the two parameters are fitted in formulas for the studied hybrid energy systems. In addition, an nZEB designed with PV& BDG system is found to have a robust performance compared with that designed with other three hybrid energy systems under the same design condition.

AB One of the methods of gas turbine performance improvement is steam injection into combustion chamber. Moreover, heat recovery is introduced as another method for enhancing energy and exergy efficiencies. In this paper, these two methods were combined in a system of Integrated Heat Recovery Steam Injected Gas Turbine (IHRSI) equipped with an anti-surge system. A heat exchanger was used for waste heat recovery of the gas turbine exhaust and steam production. In these conditions, due to the energy balance in the HRSG, there was a relation between steam temperature and steam mass flow rate. One problem in IHRSI is determining optimum steam temperature. The increment of temperature decreases the steam mass flow rate and consequently has opposite effects on the various parameters. Therefore, in the present study, a comprehensive model based on the energy, exergy, environmental and economic analyses (4E) was presented. Eventually, the developed model introduced the optimum conditions of injected steam into combustion chamber. The optimum steam temperature of 318.5 degrees C was found in the case of 38 degrees C ambient temperature and 10% relative humidity. IHRSI at the optimum steam temperature increased net power output and thermal efficiency by 56 MW and 4.6% and reduced the cost of power generation by 25.5%. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper proposes a bi-probability-interval optimization (BPIO) model for wind-solar power day-ahead scheduling (WSP-DAS) under uncertainties, which aims to obtain the optimal trade-off planning by balancing profit and risk brought by uncertain wind power and solar power penetration. First, the confidence intervals of wind power and solar power are formulated under given confidence levels of wind speed and solar radiation, respectively. Then, the distribution probabilities of each wind power and solar power are obtained accordingly based on the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of wind speed and solar radiation, respectively. Finally, the framework of BPIO based WSP-DAS is developed to balance the profit and risk, considering a conditional expectation based optimization objective. Comparative experiments are conducted on two day-ahead scheduling systems under the dynamic uncertain wind and solar power penetration. The empirical results fully demonstrate that the proposed BPIO can significantly improve the reliability and effectiveness of evaluating WSP-DAS, in terms of obtaining a trade-off planning between profit and risk against the integration of uncertain wind-solar power.

AB The objective of this article is to design and plan sustainable bio-ethanol supply chain. Modeling supply chains that achieve economic, social and environmental feasibility through production, process and energy efficiency is a challenge. Life cycle assessment that is coupled with techno-economic optimization of bio-ethanol supply chain is an alternative solution to achieve sustainability. A simulation of the biomass conversion is used to find process parameters of the conversion technology. The results show that the unified model is capable of minimizing both CO2 emissions and energy and utility consumptions. In addition, the supply chain is capable of contributing to local economy through jobs creation. While the model is quite comprehensive, the future research recommendation on energy integration and global sustainability is proposed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Combined cooling, heating and power system (CCHP) is an efficient alternative for building energy supply. Meanwhile, the advantages of high energy efficiency and low emission for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) make the technology a promising prime mover for CCHP systems. In this study, a SOFC based CCHP system design and operation optimization model has been developed using the Mixed Integer Non-linear Programming (MINLP) approach. The model provides two capacity sizing options of the fixed size (user specified), and the optimal sizing. In the fixed size option, four dispatch strategies are considered, namely baseload, day/night, full-load, and electrical load following. In the optimal sizing option, the installed capacity of devices and the dispatch strategy are both optimized. Moreover, multi-objective optimizations are also conducted to optimize two conflicting objectives simultaneously by the epsilon-constraint method. The optimal results are displayed by Pareto frontiers and the most desired solutions have been identified and verified by two decision-making approaches of LINMAP and TOPSIS. To make the model applicable to real world operation, novel constraints including part-load efficiency, equipment on/off, and numbers of start constraints are applied, Finally, the proposed model is applied to a case study of a hospital in Shanghai, China considering state-of-the-art technical specifications, time-of-use energy pricing, and emission factors. The results indicate environmental advantages of SOFC based CCHP system. Moreover, the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) identified by the proposed optimal design and dispatch model would be 0.17 $/kWh, which is lower than the conventional energy system.

AB A key element to reach sustainability in the built environment is reducing the need to compromise between performance and cost-optimality. Particularly, conversion and/or exchange of surplus energy from on-site generation components can offer opportunities to increase the overall system profitability and enhance its performance. This study addresses the cost-optimality, operational carbon dioxide emissions and exergetic performance of a single-family building with bidirectional heat and electricity exchange. Through multiobjective optimization, it compares various system configurations that have on-site heat and electricity generation components. The results show that, for systems with over similar to 4.3 kW onsite electricity generation capacity, driving a ground-source heat pump with surplus electricity to obtain heat, and export it to a district heating grid, offers optimal solutions for lifecycle costs and operational equivalent carbon dioxide emissions. Under the studied context, heat export from a ground-source heat pump driven by surplus electricity leads to nearly a fivefold increase in monetary income per unit of exported energy and to a fivefold increase in operational equivalent carbon dioxide emissions compensation. Considerable drawbacks of this are the lower exergy content and mobility of heat, compared to electricity, though these can be alleviated if the heat is used for heating purposes in nearby buildings.

AB Combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system with the prime mover set of solid oxide fuel cell-gas turbine (SOFC-GT) would feature with high electrical efficiency, but contain the highly coupled equipment units for cooling, heating and electricity supplies. Due to such complex nature of multiple supplies and demands, the previously developed control strategies were not suitable, and it is a challenge to develop an appropriate control strategy for the SOFC-GT CCHP system. Therefore, a new approach, called multi-supply-multi-demand (MSMD) control strategy, is proposed in this paper. The MSMD control includes two core algorithms: rolling optimization (RO) and feedback correction (FC). RO is used to determine the operation of energy supply equipment units based on the forecasting weather and loading information of the next 24 h. FC is applied for continual mitigation in case any difference between the actual and predicted energy demands. In the SOFC-GT CCHP system with energy storages for building application, the effectiveness of the MSMD control strategy was tested. It was found that RO could determine the operating schedules of the related equipment units at lower primary energy consumption than the conventional mean, while FC could effectively rectify the prediction errors incurred from the real-time loading conditions.

AB A DC/DC converter is a vital component for offshore DC grids, in which a medium frequency transformer (MFT) is the main element. Therefore, it is necessary to optimise the core material and the design method so that the loss of the MFT would be reduced. In this study, the multi-objective genetic algorithm is proposed, by which two MFTs with different core materials are both optimised. The magnetic flux density of the transformer core and the current density of the windings are introduced as the optimised variables. Also, the key equations for transformer design are put forward as the objective functions. Moreover, with constant iteration of the process of segmentation, parallel selection, mergence, recombination and variation, the Pareto optimal solution is determined. Furthermore, to verify the optimisation results, the temperature field and electric strength of the amorphous alloy MFT are calculated and simulated by finite-element analysis. Finally, a MFT prototype with an amorphous alloy core is built, and the experiment is carried out.

AB Many-objective Optimization Problems (MaOPs) present various challenges to the current optimization methods. Among these, the visualization gap is an important obstacle to the interpretation of results. Having the ability of visualizing partial or final results of a high-dimensional multi-objective problem provides key advantages to the optimizer and also to the decision-maker in terms of understanding the problem and interpreting results. In this article, a multi-purposed visualization tool is proposed to be applied in an evolutionary design process. The proposed visualization tool follows the circular design layout, mapping the solutions from high-dimensional objective space into a 2D form of scattering that is based on norm and angle information. Meanwhile, it preserves some desirable characteristics of objective space, such as the shape of the Pareto front, its location, relations between objectives etc. With the support of this tool the decision-maker can obtain information about the shape of the Pareto front, the range of explored area by the algorithms, qualitative estimation of algorithm performance, relation between objectives, location of solutions and their dispersion. Furthermore, this application has scalability and flexibility about the number of objectives and population Size. Finally, the proposed mapping allows the decision-maker to visually identify poorly explored regions of the objective space and determine weight vectors to guide the search to a specific or preferred region. The case studies in the experimental results show that this tool can play a role in the design process and help the evolutionary solving process. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel multi-generation hybrid system is proposed and analyzed in details from the viewpoint of thermodynamics. Using a zeotropic mixture as working fluid, the system consists of a power and ejector refrigeration cycle as well as a desalination system based on humidification and dehumidification processes. A parametric study is performed to specify the decision variables influencing the system performance prior to the optimization process. The optimization is conducted in two cases. In the first case, a single-objective optimization is carried out to maximize the overall exergy efficiency. In the second case, a multi-objective optimization is accomplished considering the net output power and refrigeration capacity as the objective functions.
   The results in the first case reveals a maximum overall exergy efficiency of 17.12% for which the net output power is 57.03 kW and the refrigeration capacity is 91.25 kW. In the case of multi-objective optimization, the results obtained from Pareto frontier shows a net produced power of 52.19 kW and a refrigeration capacity of 120.4 kW. With these data an overall exergy efficiency of 16.46% is calculated. The amount of fresh water calculated in case two is slightly higher than that obtained in case one.

AB In recent years, managers and researchers have paid increasing attention to accurate and stable wind speed prediction due to its significant effect on power dispatching and power grid security. However, most previous research has focused only on enhancing either accuracy or stability, with few studies addressing the two issues, simultaneously. This task is challenging due to the intermittency and complex fluctuations of wind speed. Therefore, we proposed a novel hybrid system based on a newly proposed called the MOWOA, which includes four modules: a data preprocessing module, optimization module, forecasting module, and evaluation module. An effective decomposing technique is also applied to eliminate redundant noise and extract the primary characteristics of wind speed data. In order to obtain high accuracy, and stability for wind speed prediction simultaneously, and overcome the weaknesses of single objective optimization algorithms, the optimization module of the proposed MOWOA is utilized to optimize the weights and thresholds of the Elman neutral network used in the forecasting module. Finally, the evaluation module, which includes hypothesis testing, evaluation criteria, and three experiments, is introduced perform comprehensive evaluation on the system. The results indicate that the proposed MOWOA performs better than the two recently developed MOALO and MODA algorithms, and that the proposed hybrid model outperforms all sixteen models used for comparison, which demonstrates its superior ability to generate forecasts in terms of forecasting accuracy and stability.

AB Solar radiation forecasting plays a significant role in precisely designing solar energy systems and in the efficient management of solar energy plants. Most research only focuses on accuracy improvements; however, for an effective forecasting model, considering only accuracy or stability is inadequate. To solve this problem, a combined model based on nondominated sorting-based multiobjective bat algorithm (NSMOBA) is developed for the optimization of weight coefficients of each model to achieve high accuracy and stability results simultaneously. In addition, a statistical method and data mining-based approach are used to determine the input variables for constructing the combined model. Monthly average solar radiation and meteorological variables from six datasets in the U.S. collected for case studies were used to assess the comprehensive performance (both in accuracy and stability) of the proposed combined model. The simulation in four experiments demonstrated the following: (a) the proposed combined model is suitable for providing accurate and stable solar radiation forecasting; (b) the combined model exhibits a more competitive forecasting performance than the individual models by using the advantage of each model; (c) the NSMOBA is an efficient algorithm for providing accurate forecasting results and improving the stability where the single bat algorithm is insufficient.

AB This study presents an experimental investigation of a free piston expander-linear generator (FPE-LG) used for organic Rankine cycle (ORC) waste heat recovery system. A FPE-LG test rig using compressed air as working fluid is established. The motion characteristics, dynamic characteristics and the indicated efficiency of FPE-LG are analyzed. The motion characteristics and power output performance for different valve timings are studied. The degree of symmetry is defined to evaluate the asymmetry motion characteristics of the free piston assembly. The coefficient of cycle-to-cycle variation (COV) is presented to evaluate the cycle-to-cycle variation characteristics of the FPE-LG. Experimental results show that the free piston assembly displacement profile is similar to a sinusoidal wave and the free piston assembly can operate at high and relatively constant speed at the middle portion of the stroke. The maximum power output of 19 W can be achieved when the intake pressure is 2.0 bar and the operation frequency is 2.5 Hz. The valve timing and intake pressure demonstrate a significant influence on the asymmetric motion and the power output performance of the FPE-LG. The indicated efficiency of the FPE (left cylinder) decreases with the increase in the intake pressure. The maximum indicated efficiency reaches 92.8% when the intake pressure is 1.4 bar and the operation frequency is 2.0 Hz. The indicated efficiency firstly increases and then decreases with the increase in the operation frequency. The COV of the FPE-LG decreases with increasing the intake pressure. The motion stability of FPE-LG improves with the increase in the intake pressure. Valve timing and valve train should be optimized in the near future.

AB This paper proposes a new stochastic multi-objective framework for optimal dynamic planning of interconnected microgrids (MGs) under uncertainty from economic, technical, reliability and environmental viewpoints. In the proposed approach, optimal site, size, type, and time of distributed energy resources are determined along with optimal allocation of section switches to partitioning conventional distribution system into a number of interconnected MGs. The uncertainties of the problem are considered using scenario modelling and backward scenario reduction technique is implemented to deal with computational burden. In addition, three different risk averse, risk neutral and risk seeker strategies are defined for distribution network operator. The proposed framework is considered as two unparalleled objective functions which the first objective minimizes the investment cost, operation and maintenance cost, power loss cost and pollutants emission cost and the second objective is defined to minimize energy not supplied in both connected and islanded modes of MGs. Finally, multi objective particle swarm optimization is applied to minimize the proposed bi-objective functions and subsequently fuzzy satisfying method is accomplished to select the best solution proportional to risk based strategies. Efficiency of the proposed framework is validated on 85-bus distribution system and obtained results are presented and discussed.

AB This research investigates the applicability of an ANN and genetic algorithms for modeling and multiobjective optimization of the thermal conductivity and viscosity of water-based spinel-type MnFe2O4 nanofluid. Levenberg-Marquardt, quasi-Newton, and resilient backpropagation methods are employed to train the ANN. The support vector machine (SVM) method is also presented for comparative purposes. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the developed ANN with the LM-BR training algorithm and the 3-10-10-2 structure for the prediction of the thermophysical properties of nanofluids in terms of the significantly superior accuracy compared to developing the correlation and employing SVM regression. Moreover, the genetic algorithm is implemented to determine the optimal conditions, i.e., maximum thermal conductivity and minimum nanofluid viscosity, based on the developed ANN.

AB In this work, we address the life cycle economic and environmental optimization of a supply chain network considering both design and operational decisions under uncertainty. A modeling framework is proposed that integrates the functional-unit-based life cycle optimization methodology and the two stage stochastic programming approach for sustainable supply chain optimization under uncertainty. We develop a stochastic mixed-integer linear fractional programming (SMILFP) model to tackle multiple uncertainties regarding feedstock supply and product demand. To address the computational challenge of solving the resulting large-scale SMILFP problems, an efficient solution algorithm is developed that takes advantage of the efficiency of parametric algorithm and the decomposition-based multi-cut L-shaped method. We present a case study based on a spatially explicit model for the optimal design and operations of a county-level hydrocarbon biofuel supply chain in Illinois to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed modeling framework and the efficiency of the solution algorithm.

AB The Black Sea is one of the world's most polluted seas. Chemicals such as oil, fertilizers, insecticides and herbicides which do not decompose in the ground, enter the Black Sea, which becomes a huge repository for these collections mixed fertilizers and poisons. Domestic wastewater significantly contributes to pollution with organic matter and nutrients, and may be responsible for the spreading of diseases. A major component of the synergistic strategies for the environmental protection of the Black Sea consists the proper wastewater treatment. It is necessary to limit the amounts of nutrients such as ammonia, which may be discharged in treated effluents, to prevent excessive growths of algae and aquatic plants that can cause serious harm or even destroy the aesthetic value of water. In the frame of a case study, on the base of Bardenpho process, the simulation of remediation the increasing of ammonia concentration in municipal wastewater effluents was done using the SuperPro Designer v8.5 simulator. The reducing of ammonia concentrations in effluent was realized by modifications of several operating process parameters and the ammonia concentrations in effluent were decreased below the maximum legal admitted concentration. Also it was investigated the effect of the recirculated flow rate over the effluent ammonia concentration and over the total operating cost, which is a multiobjective optimization problem.

AB Globally, maintaining equilibrium between energy supply and demand is critical in urban areas facing increasing energy consumption and high-speed economic development. As an alternative, the large-scale application of renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, might be a long-term solution in an urban context. This study assessed the overall utilization potential of a building-integrated photovoltaic and wind turbine (BIPvWt) system, which can be applied to a building skin in global urban areas. The first step of this study was to reorganize the large volume of global annual climate data. The data were analyzed by computational fluid dynamic analysis and an energy simulation applicable to the BIPvWt system, which can generate a P-max 300 Wp/module with a 15% conversion efficiency from a photovoltaic (PV) system and a 0.149 power coefficient/module from wind turbines in categorized urban contexts and office buildings in specific cities; it was constructed to evaluate and optimize the ratio that can cover the current energy consumption. A diagram of the distribution of the solar and wind energy potential and design guidelines for a building skin were developed. The perspective of balancing the increasing energy consumption using renewable energy in urban areas can be visualized positively in the near future.

AB In this paper, we propose an improved nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II with scope constrained (INSGA-II/SC) with three modifications, which are dynamic nondomination strategy, scope-constrained strategy, and front uniformly distributed strategy. Here, the metric for multiobjective optimization mainly focuses on the computation complexity, convergence, and diversity of the final solutions. For a large search space in the initial process and a fast convergence in the last process, dynamic nondomination factor is considered in the rank operator. We can find a manageable number of Pareto solutions that are in the constrained scope instead of the entire Pareto front (PF) to reduce the computation complexity by scope-constrained strategy. In order to obtain a high performance for good representatives of the entire PF, the solutions closer to the uniformly distributed points on the current front will be chosen. In this paper, the proposed methods and two efficient multiobjective optimization methods are used for the optimization of mathematical problems and array pattern synthesis with lower side lobe level (SLL) and null. Numerical examples show that INSGA-II/SC has a high performance of diversity and convergence for the final solutions when compared with the other techniques published in the literature.

AB Multiple uncertainties exist in the optimal flood control decision-making process, presenting risks involving flood control decisions. This paper defines the main steps in optimal flood control decision making that constitute the Forecast-Optimization-Decision Making (FODM) chain. We propose a framework for supporting optimal flood control decision making under multiple uncertainties and evaluate risk propagation along the FODM chain from a holistic perspective. To deal with uncertainties, we employ stochastic models at each link of the FODM chain. We generate synthetic ensemble flood forecasts via the martingale model of forecast evolution. We then establish a multiobjective stochastic programming with recourse model for optimal flood control operation. The Pareto front under uncertainty is derived via the constraint method coupled with a two-step process. We propose a novel SMAA-TOPSIS model for stochastic multicriteria decision making. Then we propose the risk assessment model, the risk of decision-making errors and rank uncertainty degree to quantify the risk propagation process along the FODM chain. We conduct numerical experiments to investigate the effects of flood forecast uncertainty on optimal flood control decision making and risk propagation. We apply the proposed methodology to a flood control system in the Daduhe River basin in China. The results indicate that the proposed method can provide valuable risk information in each link of the FODM chain and enable risk-informed decisions with higher reliability.

AB To promote sustainable development, the smart city implies a global vision that merges artificial intelligence, big data, decision making, information and communication technology (ICT), and the internet-of-things (IoT). The ageing issue is an aspect that researchers, companies and government should devote efforts in developing smart healthcare innovative technology and applications. In this paper, the topic of disease diagnosis in smart healthcare is reviewed. Typical emerging optimization algorithms and machine learning algorithms are summarized. Evolutionary optimization, stochastic optimization and combinatorial optimization are covered. Owning to the fact that there are plenty of applications in healthcare, four applications in the field of diseases diagnosis (which also list in the top 10 causes of global death in 2015), namely cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, and tuberculosis, are considered. In addition, challenges in the deployment of disease diagnosis in healthcare have been discussed.

AB In the current context of increasing energy demand, timber-glass buildings will become a necessary trend in sustainable architecture in the future. Especially in severe cold zones of China, energy consumption and the visual comfort of residential buildings have attracted wide attention, and there are always trade-offs between multiple objectives. This paper aims to propose a simulation-based multiobjective optimization method to improve the daylighting, energy efficiency, and economic performance of timber-glass buildings in severe cold regions. Timber-glass building form variables have been selected as the decision variables, including building width, roof height, south and north window-to-wall ratio (WWR), window height, and orientation. A simulation-based multiobjective optimization model has been developed to optimize these performance objectives simultaneously. The results show that Daylighting Autonomy (DA) presents negative correlations with Energy Use Intensity (EUI) and total cost. Additionally, with an increase in DA, Useful Daylighting Illuminance (UDI) demonstrates a tendency of primary increase and then decrease. Using this optimization model, four building performances have been improved from the initial generation to the final generation, which proves that simulation-based multiobjective optimization is a promising approach to improve the daylighting, energy efficiency, and economic performances of timber-glass buildings in severe cold regions.

AB The development of green building is an important way to solve the environmental problems of China's construction industry. Energy conservation and energy utilization are important for the green building evaluation criteria (GBEC). The objective of this study is to evaluate the quantitative relationship between building shape parameter, envelope parameters, shading system, courtyard and the energy consumption (EC) as well as the impact on indoor thermal comfort of rural residential buildings in the hot summer and warm winter zone (HWWZ). Taking Quanzhou (Fujian Province of China) as an example, based on the field investigation, EnergyPlus is used to build the building performance model. In addition, the classical particle swarm optimization algorithm in GenOpt software is used to optimize the various factors affecting the EC. Single-objective optimization has provided guidance to the multi-dimensional optimization and regression analysis is used to find the effects of a single input variable on an output variable. Results shows that the energy saving rate of an optimized rural residence is about 26-30% corresponding to the existing rural residence. Moreover, the payback period is about 20 years. A simple case study is used to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed optimization analysis. The optimization can be used to guide the design of new rural construction in the area and the energy saving transformation of the existing rural houses, which can help to achieve the purpose of energy saving and comfort.

AB To cope with Post-2020', each country set its national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction target (e.g., South Korea: 37%) below its business-as-usual level by 2030. Toward this end, it is necessary to implement the net-zero energy building (nZEB) in the building sector, which accounts for more than 25% of the national GHG emissions and has a great potential to reduce GHG emissions. In this context, this study conducted a state-of-the-art review of nZEB implementation strategies in terms of passive strategies (i.e., passive sustainable design and energy-saving technique) and active strategies (i.e., renewable energy (RE) and back-up system for RE). Additionally, this study proposed the following advanced strategies for nZEB implementation according to a building's life cycle: (i) integration and optimization of the passive and active strategies in the early phase of a building's life cycle; (ii) real-time monitoring of the energy performance during the usage phase of a building's life cycle. It is expected that this study can help researchers, practitioners, and policymakers understand the overall implementation strategies for realizing nZEB.

AB Chromatographic separation with solid stationary and fluid mobile phases is widely used to isolate and purify compounds. One of the most productive improvements in preparative chromatography is the simulated moving bed (SMB) process, which enables continuous feed supply and product removal by periodic operation of a multicolumn to simulate a countercurrent flow between the phases. The SMB process produces high-purity compounds, even with low selectivity, and offers higher productivity and lower eluent consumption than batch chromatography. Recently, intensive efforts have been made to expand the range of applications through the design, modeling, and optimization of the SMB process to produce advanced operating strategies, which are described and evaluated in this review.

AB Multiobjective optimizations of a micromixer with two-layer serpentine crossing channels were performed at two different Reynolds numbers by using a multiobjective genetic algorithm and surrogate modeling based on a Navier-Stokes analysis. The optimizations included three dimensionless design variables, namely, ratios of the diagonal channel width to the pitch length, the main channel width to the pitch length, and the channel depth to the pitch length. The design space was confirmed by a parametric study, and the Latin hypercube sampling technique was used to select design points within the design space. The Kriging meta-model was applied for surrogate modeling of the objective functions.Concave Pareto-optimal fronts representing the trade-offs between the objective functions were obtained through the optimizations.

AB This paper addresses hybrid flow shop scheduling problem (HFSP) with assembly operations, in which parts of each product are produced in a hybrid flow shop and then assembled at an assembly stage. The goal is to minimize total tardiness, maximum tardiness and makespan simultaneously. Tardiness objectives are regarded as key ones because of their relative importance and this situation is seldom considered. A simple strategy is applied to handle the optimization with key objectives. A novel neighborhood search with global exchange (NSG) is proposed, in which a part-based coding method is adopted and global exchange is cooperated with neighborhood search to produce high quality solution. Extensive experiments are conducted and the results show that the strategy on key objectives is reasonable and effective and NSG is a very competitive method for the considered HFSP.

AB An important open problem in robotic planning is the autonomous generation of 3D inspection paths that is, planning the best path to move a robot along in order to inspect a target structure. We recently suggested a new method for planning paths allowing the inspection of complex 3D structures, given a triangular mesh model of the structure. The method differs from previous approaches in its emphasis on generating and considering also plans that result in imperfect coverage of the inspection target. In many practical tasks, one would accept imperfections in coverage if this results in a substantially more energy efficient inspection path. The key idea is using a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to optimize the energy usage and coverage of inspection plans simultaneously- and the result is a set of plans exploring the different ways to balance the two objectives. We here test our method on a set of inspection targets with large variation in size and complexity, and compare its performance with two state-of-the-art methods for complete coverage path planning. The results strengthen our confidence in the ability of our method to generate good inspection plans for different types of targets. The method's advantage is most clearly seen for real-world inspection targets, since traditional complete coverage methods have no good way of generating plans for structures with hidden parts. Multiobjective evolution, by optimizing energy usage and coverage together, ensures a good balance between the two-both when 100% coverage is feasible, and when large parts of the object are hidden.

AB The box-covering method is widely used on measuring the fractal property on complex networks. The problem of finding the minimum number of boxes to tile a network is known as a NP-hard problem. Many algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem. All the current box-covering algorithms regard the box number minimization as the only objective. However, the fractal modularity of the network partition divided by the box-covering method, has been proved to be strongly related to the information transportation in complex networks. Maximizing the fractal modularity is also important in the box-covering method, which can be divided into two objectives: maximization of ratio association and minimization of ratio cut. In this paper, to solve the dilemma of minimizing the box number and maximizing the fractal modularity at the same time, a multiobjective discrete particle swarm optimization box-covering (MOPSOBC) algorithm is proposed. The MOPSOBC algorithm applies the decomposition approach on the two objectives to approximate the Pareto front. The proposed MOPSOBC algorithm has been applied to six benchmark networks and compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, including two classical box covering algorithms, four single objective optimization algorithms and six multiobjective optimization algorithms. The experimental results show that the MOPSOBC algorithm can get similar box numbers with the current best algorithm, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms on the fractal modularity and normalized mutual information.

AB The world around us may be viewed as a network of entities interconnected via their social, economic, and political interactions. These entities and their interactions form a social network. A social network is often modeled as a graph whose nodes represent entities, and edges represent interactions between these entities. These networks are characterized by the collective latent behavior that does not follow trivially from the behaviors of the individual entities in the network. One such behavior is the existence of hierarchy in the network structure, the sub-networks being popularly known as communities. Discovery of the community structure in a social network is a key problem in social network analysis as it refines our understanding of the social fabric. Not surprisingly, the problem of detecting communities in social networks has received substantial attention from the researchers.
   In this paper, we propose parallel implementations of recently proposed community detection algorithms that employ variants of the well-known quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm (QIEA). Like any other evolutionary algorithm, a quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm is also characterized by the representation of the individual, the evaluation function, and the population dynamics. However, individual bits called qubits, are in a superposition of states. As chromosomes evolve individually, the quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms (QIEAs) are intrinsically suitable for parallelization. In recent years, programmable graphics processing units - GPUs, have evolved into massively parallel environments with tremendous computational power. NVIDIA (R) compute unified device architecture (CUDA) technology, one of the leading general-purpose parallel computing architectures with hundreds of cores, can concurrently run thousands of computing threads. The paper proposes novel parallel implementations of quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms in the field of community detection on CUDA-enabled GPUs.
   The proposed implementations employ a single-population fine-grained approach that is suited for massively parallel computations. In the proposed approach, each element of a chromosome is assigned to a separate thread. It is observed that the proposed algorithms perform significantly better than the benchmark algorithms. Further, the proposed parallel implementations achieve significant speedup over the serial versions. Due to the highly parallel nature of the proposed algorithms, an increase in the number of multiprocessors and GPU devices may lead to a further speedup. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, many researchers have put emphasis on the study of how to keep a good balance between convergence and diversity in many-objective optimization. This paper proposes a new many-objective evolutionary algorithm based on a projection-assisted intro family election. In the proposed algorithm, basic evolution directions are adaptively generated according to the current population and potential evolution directions are excavated in each individual's family. Based on these evolution directions, a strategy of intro family election is performed in every family and elite individuals are elected as representatives of the specific family to join the next stage, which can enhance the convergence of the algorithm. Moreover, a selection procedure based on angles is used to maintain the diversity. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified and compared with several state-of-the-art many-objective evolutionary algorithms on a variety of well-known benchmark problems ranging from 5 to 20 objectives. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other peer algorithms in terms of both the diversity and the convergence of the final solutions set on most of the test instances. In particular, our proposed algorithm shows obvious superiority when handling the problems with larger number of objectives. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In evolutionary many-objective optimization, diversity maintenance plays an important role in pushing the population towards the Pareto optimal front. Existing many-objective evolutionary algorithms mainly focus on convergence enhancement, but pay less attention to diversity enhancement, which may fail to obtain uniformly distributed solutions or fall into local optima. This paper proposes a radial space division based evolutionary algorithm for many-objective optimization, where the solutions in high-dimensional objective space are projected into the grid divided 2-dimensional radial space for diversity maintenance and convergence enhancement. Specifically, the diversity of the population is emphasized by selecting solutions from different grids, where an adaptive penalty based approach is proposed to select a better converged solution from the grid with multiple solutions for convergence enhancement. The proposed algorithm is compared with five state-of-the-art many-objective evolutionary algorithms on a variety of benchmark test problems. Experimental results demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of both convergence enhancement and diversity maintenance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the paper, we proposed a novel multi-swarm particle swarm optimization with dynamic learning strategy (PSO-DLS) to improve the performance of PSO. To promote information exchange among sub swarms, the particle classification mechanism advocates that particles in each sub-swarm are classified into ordinary particles and communication particles with different tasks at each iteration. The ordinary particles focus on exploitation under the guidance of the local best position in its sub-swarm, while the communication particles with dynamic ability that focus on exploration under the guidance of a united local best position in a new search region promote information to be exchanged among sub-swarms. Moreover the strategy sets a dynamic control mechanism with an increasing parameter p for implementing the classification operation, which provides ordinary particles an increasing sense of evolution into communication particles during the searching process. A simple case of analysis on searching behavior supports its remarkable impact on maintaining the diversity and searching a better solution. Experimental results on 15 function problems of CEC 2015 for 10 and 30 dimensions also demonstrate its promising effectiveness in solving complex problems statistically comparing to other algorithms. What's more, the computational times reveal the subtle design of PSO-DLS. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Forest trees' harvesting is a critical activity in the forest ecosystem management process. This activity is among the most destructive practices and causes ecological damage on the forest ecosystem. The traditional way of trees' harvesting is not rational and should be optimized to reduce damage and to improve the profitability of forest resources. Besides, a cost-effective and ecologically-aware harvesting activity is likely to guarantee a sustainable management while ensuring a satisfactory financial benefit. We are interested in this paper in optimizing the direction of trees cutting to reduce ecological damage while taking into account spatial and financial constraints of loggers. We propose a multicriteriageo-optimization approach based on a combination of optimization techniques and GIS functionalities. The optimization method is based on the search for the minimum of a weighted sum of spatial, financial and ecological costs. In this work, we consider various criteria: (1) spatial criteria to consider adjacency restrictions; (2) financial criteria to preserve crop trees for future operations and to facilitate the transport of stems to the log yard; (3) ecological criteria to reduce the destruction of trees and soil degradation. Moreover, spatial data are extracted from Raster-based GIS and used to select trees to be accessed as well as to estimate the cost of cutting and transporting them. We present the results of experiments on real data from the Neotropical forest of French Guiana.

AB MicroRNA (miRNA) plays vital roles in biological processes like RNA splicing and regulation of gene expression. Studies have revealed that there might be possible links between oncogenesis and expression profiles of some miRNAs, due to their differential expression between normal and tumor tissues. However, the automatic classification of miRNAs into different categories by considering the similarity of their expression values has rarely been addressed. This article proposes a solution framework for solving some real-life classification problems related to cancer, miRNA, and mRNA expression datasets. In the first stage, a multiobjective optimization based framework, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II, is proposed to automatically determine the appropriate classifier type, along with its suitable parameter and feature combinations, pertinent for classifying a given dataset. In the second page, a stack-based ensemble technique is employed to get a single combinatorial solution from the set of solutions obtained in the first stage. The performance of the proposed two-stage approach is evaluated on several cancer and RNA expression profile datasets. Compared to several state-of-the-art approaches for classifying different datasets, our method shows supremacy in the accuracy of classification.

AB An innovative methodological paradigm is proposed for the design of unconventional antenna systems for future 5G base stations. In such a codesign strategy, the antenna element (a spline-shaped patch embedded in a finite-array model) and the overall irregularly clustered-array layout are simultaneously synthesized through a multiobjective antenna-shape optimization combined with a subarraying technique based on a new single-objective integer-coded genetic algorithm able to intrinsically handle constraints on the cluster shapes/types. Selected numerical examples, drawn from an exhaustive design process, are presented to assess the advantages and the effectiveness of the proposed co-design scheme in view of the final manufacturing of 5G base stations thanks to its capability to take into account the impact of mutual coupling, nonideal antenna patterns, and implementation limitations.

AB This paper proposes an enhancement of the low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) capability of multilevel flying capacitors inverter using an improved model predictive control (MPC). The proposed solution is a multiobjective control strategy ensuring simultaneous capacitors' voltages balancing and grid current injection with reduced total harmonics distortion (THD) and unity power factor even under severe voltage sags. The proposed MPC technique makes use of a multioptimization solution for the common problem of weight dissimilarity of the control objectives. The first optimization is achieved by the inclusion of the state variables normalization within the cost function computation. This will provide to the proposed MPC technique more robustness with the ability to take into consideration external disturbances (grid voltage sag) while ensuring the meeting of the state variables constraints. The second one is achieved through accurately tuning the weighting factor based on minimizing the grid current total harmonics distortion and the maximal errors on the capacitors' voltages. Theoretical analysis and simulation results are presented to prove that the presented solution guarantees continuous and smooth power transfer to the grid even under severe voltage sags. The obtained results are validated on a 1-kW experimental prototype.

AB This study aims at revealing the effect of the simple control of oxidizer flux on a hybrid rocket engine for an efficient extinction-reignition sequence to extend the downrange as well as the duration in the lower thermosphere. The data mining result in the prior study achieved a hypothesis that the thrust control between 1st and 2nd combustions spurs improving extinction-reignition performance. Accordingly, this study simply defines two amounts of oxidizer flux for 1st and 2nd combustions; we investigate using the design informatics platform whether this simple control of oxidizer flux is practically effective to improving extinction-reignition performance. Consequently, oxidizer flux control successfully fulfills the downrange extension as well as the duration protraction as we had expected. Furthermore, the evolutionary multiobjective optimization generates non-simple structure of the feasible region in the design space. Trajectory analyses for signature individuals and a data mining have specified detailed design strategies. In addition, they have also explained physical reasons why the non-simple structure is formed. Extinction-reignition with oxidizer flux control is useful for efficient operations of the hybrid rocket system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

ID EXECUTION
AB Building composite value-added services by combining basic services has become a prevalent way of software development. To provide the dependability in a composite service it is essential to combine the backward and forward recovery strategies properly based on composition level quality of service (QoS) factors or user preferences. The backward recovery, known as a fault-tolerance (FT) technique, is performed by compensating the successfully terminated services dependent on the failed service which may entail rollback costs. The forward recovery is achieved by applying FT patterns to each workflow task to decrease its failure rate. It has the disadvantages of longer invocation time and cost. Obviously the success of these methods in finding transactional compositions is highly dependent on the compensateability and retriability of services. In this study, four composition-level QoS factors have been defined to select between the forward or backward recovery strategies in the workflow. The problem of creating a dependable composite service is formulated as a multiobjective optimisation algorithm which explores not only the huge search space of different recovery strategies but also the cross-cutting search space of task scheduling. The effect of task scheduling on finding solutions with lower costs has been verified using case studies.

AB Traditional portfolio models such as the mean-variance framework lean to yield a concentration in a small amount of assets and uncertainty in outcomes due to its sensitivity to the bias in estimation. We develop a portfolio model that synthesizes the techniques improving investment diversity with return forecasting. Specifically, we integrate Yager (1995) entropy with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and evaluate the ex post performance of various models by using the data of the S & P 500 stocks. The results show that the entropy model yields higher performance, lower trading costs, and higher portfolio diversity than the corresponding MV model. Adding return forecasting in the entropy model increases portfolio efficiency to respond the market dynamics, especially during the market downturn. Due to its linearity, Yager entropy is more computationally efficient than the MV model and can be useful to asset management.

AB Size, shape, and polymorphic form are the critical attributes of crystalline particles and represent the major focus of today's crystallization process design. This work demonstrates how crystal properties can be tuned efficiently in solution via a tubular crystallizer that facilitates rapid temperature cycling. Controlled crystal growth, dissolution, and secondary nucleation allow a precise control of the crystal size and shape distribution, as well as polymorphic composition. Tubular crystallizers utilizing segmented flow such as the one presented in our work can provide plug flow characteristics, fast heating and cooling, allowing for rapid changes of the supersaturation. This makes them superior for crystal engineering over common crystallizers. Characterization of particle transport, however, revealed that careful selection of process parameters, such as tubing diameter, flow rates, solvents, etc., is crucial to achieve the full benefits of such reactors.

AB Ultra-dense networks are envisioned as essential to embrace the skyrocketed traffic for the next-generation wireless networks. In this paper, we consider the uplink transmissions in ultra-dense networks, where the increased interference along with the increased density significantly challenges the efficient utilization of network resources as well as the provisioning of users' quality of services (QoS). Targeting these issues, we consider the QoS in terms of target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and power consumption simultaneously for each user within a multi-objective optimization model. We then investigate the interactions among users by leveraging the non-cooperative game-theoretical framework. By characterizing the properties of Nash equilibrium, we develop the target-SINR oriented resource allocation (TORA) algorithm, which features distributed implementation. Moreover, we obtain the condition to guarantee the convergence of our proposed TORA algorithm and demonstrate that it adapts to different interfering scenarios. Furthermore, considering the heterogeneous service requirements in real practice, we also design the target-SINR constrained resource allocation (TCRA) algorithm, such that TORA and TCRA are able to cope with voice and data services, respectively. Also provided are the simulation results, which demonstrate that, compared with the counterparts, our proposals more effectively guarantee the target-SINR for users with efficient power utilization.

AB In this paper, a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC)-heat engine hybrid system is investigated in terms of the environment and sustainability. The MCFC is a premier power generator, and the high-temperature waste heat supplied by the fuel cell is used as a heat source at an irreversible heat engine. This irreversible heat engine is the secondary power generator of the system. The thermo-environmental function and exergetic sustainability index are applied to design an environmentally friendly MCFC-heat engine hybrid system. Results are obtained numerically, and an ecologically friendly operation range is attempted to determine the considered system. According to calculations, the maximum power density of the hybrid system is 4,242.62 Wm(-2), and the maximum thermo-environmental function density and the exergetic sustainable index are equal to 0.0309 Wmpts(-1) m(2) and 107.36, respectively. Finally, it is recommended that current density should be chosen between current density at the maximum exergetic sustainable index and current density at the maximum thermo-environmental function for a less environmentally harmful system.

AB Frameworks for optimal reservoir operation play an important role in the management of water resources and delivery of economic benefits. Effective utilization and conservation of water from reservoirs helps to manage water deficit periods. The main challenge in reservoir optimization is to design operating rules that can be used to inform real-time decisions on reservoir release. We develop a bio-inspired framework for the optimization of reservoir release to satisfy the diverse needs of various stakeholders. In this work, single-objective optimization and multiobjective optimization problems are formulated using an algorithm known as "strawberry optimization" and tested with actual reservoir data. Results indicate that well planned reservoir operations lead to efficient deployment of the reservoir water with the help of optimal release patterns.

AB Frequency-selective surfaces (FSSs) have many applications in spatial filtering of electromagnetic waves and are commonly used in antennas, polarizers, radomes, and intelligent architecture. Conventional FSS designs have ranged from canonical shapes and fractal patterns on planar surfaces to miniaturized and multilayer designs, with stable filtering responses up to 50 degrees. Much less work has been done on 3-D FSS designs, which include multiresonant structures or cavities that offer improved angular stability, with fields of view up to 60 degrees. Recent advances in additive manufacturing techniques have made fully 3-D FSS designs increasingly popular; however, powerful design tools to exploit such fabrication methods are currently unavailable. In this paper, multiobjective lazy ant colony optimization (MOLACO), an adaptive combinatorial optimization algorithm based on ant colony optimization, is introduced and applied to the problem of polarization and angle independent 3-D FSS design. It will be shown that the MOLACO algorithm generates several innovative and unintuitive unit cell geometries with a single-zero, single-pole response, less than 1% shift from center frequencies and -10 dB rejection and 3 dB transmission bandwidths between 6%-12% for angles of incidence up to 80 degrees in TE and TM polarizations. Comparisons are made between designs generated by MOLACO and existing FSS designs.

AB A tactical vehicle should have air transportability for rapid attack and should satisfy its basic role for ground transportation. Airlift provision must be developed for aerial transportation of tactical vehicles by helicopter. The design points of front and rear lifting devices should be constructed, and the sling loads should be calculated according to various flight conditions to maintain a stable position in the air transportation of a military vehicle. The sling loads that act on the design points of airlift provision can be calculated by the analytic method defined in MIL-STD-209K. However, the actual sling loads could be different from theoretical sling loads due to vehicle specification, airlifting mechanism, and flight environment. Therefore, a virtual analysis environment for the development of airlift devices should be constructed. To establish an optimal design of airlift provision, accurate sling loads should be calculated through flight simulation, and the base model of airlift provision should be constructed based on calculated loads. In this study, we proposed an integrated process for the selection of design parameters, design of experiment, and approximate optimal design of a Korean light tactical vehicle with lightweight airlift provision.

AB In this paper, a Dielectrophoretic (DEP) particle separation device is optimized with the purpose of maximizing a separation throughput. The DEP separation device is composed of a flow channel with electrodes where particles suspended in a flowing medium are separated using the DEP phenomenon; namely, the force exerted on a polarized particle under a non-uniform electric field. Here, the electrode configuration of the device is optimized to overcome low separation throughput that is a main weak point of the DEP device. More specifically, the length and location of positive and negative electrode pieces are optimized for two objectives: The maximization of medium outlet speed and minimization of applied voltage strength. The higher medium speed raises separation throughput, and the lower voltage strength alleviates particle damage. Particle trajectory is calculated by applying a particle dynamics simulation incorporating electric field and fluid analyses. The calculated outlet location of a particle is confined inside the desired region to ensure the success of particle separation. The formulated constrained multi-objective optimization problem is solved using the Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). The irregularly distributed electrode arrays are obtained as design results, and performances of benchmark and optimized designs are compared. The comparison result shows that 294 % higher throughput can be achieved by optimized irregular electrode array distribution.

AB A key enabler for the smart grid is the fine-grained monitoring of power utilization. Although such a mechanism is helpful in the optimization of the whole electricity generation, distribution, and consumption cycle, it also creates opportunities for the potential adversaries in deducing the activities and habits of the subscribers. In fact, by utilizing the standard and readily available tools of nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) techniques on the metered electricity data, many details of customers' personal lives can be easily discovered. Therefore, prevention of such adversarial exploitations is of utmost importance for privacy protection. One strong privacy preservation approach is the modification of the metered data through the use of on-site storage units in conjunction with renewable energy resources. In this study, we introduce a novel mathematical programming framework to model eight privacy-enhanced power-scheduling strategies inspired and elicited from the literature. We employ all the relevant techniques for the modification of the actual electricity utilization (i.e., on-site battery, renewable energy resources, and appliance load moderation). Our evaluation framework is the first in the literature, to the best of our knowledge, for a comprehensive and fair comparison of the load-shaping techniques for privacy preservation. In addition to the privacy concerns, we consider monetary cost and disutility of the users in our objective functions. Evaluation results show that privacy preservation strategies in the literature differ significantly in terms of privacy, cost, and disutility metrics.

AB In this study, we aimed to develop an optimal groundwater remediation design for sites contaminated by dense non-aqueous phase liquids by using an ensemble of surrogates and adaptive sequential sampling. Compared with previous approaches, our proposed method has the following advantages: (1) a surrogate surfactant-enhanced aquifer remediation simulation model is constructed using a Gaussian process; (2) the accuracy of the surrogate model is improved by constructing ensemble surrogates using five different surrogate modelling techniques, i.e., polynomial response surface, radial basis function, Kriging, support vector regression, and Gaussian process; (3) we conducted comparisons and analyses based on 31 surrogate models derived from different combinations of the five surrogate modelling techniques; and (4) the reliability of the optimal solution was improved by implementing adaptive sequential sampling. The two proposed methods were applied to a hypothetical perchloroethylene-contaminated site in order to demonstrate their performance. The results showed that the best surrogate model integrated all five of the surrogate modelling methods, with an R-2 value of 0.9913 and a root mean squared error of 0.0159, thereby demonstrating the advantage of using ensemble surrogates. In addition, the reliability of the optimization model solution was improved by adaptive sequential sampling, which avoided false solutions.

AB Hydrometeorological data are needed for obtaining point and areal mean, quantifying the spatial variability of hydrometeorological variables, and calibration and verification of hydrometeorological models. Hydrometeorological networks are utilized to collect such data. Since data collection is expensive, it is essential to design an optimal network based on the minimal number of hydrometeorological stations in order to reduce costs. This study proposes a two-phase copula entropy-based multiobjective optimization approach that includes: (1) copula entropy-based directional information transfer (CDIT) for clustering the potential hydrometeorological gauges into several groups, and (2) multiobjective method for selecting the optimal combination of gauges for regionalized groups. Although entropy theory has been employed for network design before, the joint histogram method used for mutual information estimation has several limitations. The copula entropy-based mutual information (MI) estimation method is shown to be more effective for quantifying the uncertainty of redundant information than the joint histogram OH) method. The effectiveness of this approach is verified by applying to one type of hydrometeorological gauge network, with the use of three model evaluation measures, including Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient (NSC), arithmetic mean of the negative copula entropy (MNCE), and MNCE/NSC. Results indicate that the two-phase copula entropy-based multiobjective technique is capable of evaluating the performance of regional hydrometeorological networks and can enable decision makers to develop strategies for water resources management.

AB This research addresses a demand side management (DSM) system coordinated with Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading among the households in the smart grid. It considers the components which have significant impact on cost optimization, e.g., storage, renewables, and microgrid. The model utilizes load and source scheduling, and energy trading strategies for cost optimization. It also addresses the inconvenience created to the users by delaying certain tasks. The contributions of the research are threefold. First, to our knowledge, this is the first optimal model which integrates DSM with P2P energy trading. The solutions of the proposed model determine optimal microgrid energy and price for P2P trading, which was not considered previously. Second, P2P energy trading in the microgrid potentially results in an unfair cost distribution among the participating households. We address this unfair cost distribution problem by employing Pareto optimality, ensuring that no households will be worse off to improve the cost of others. Third, our proposed trading strategy considers total cost optimization in a microgrid. The model utilizes all available energy to minimize energy cost. Therefore, there is a very low risk of energy waste, which is typically neglected in other energy trading strategies.

AB The thermodynamic efficiency of Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) obtained from experimental systems has been obviously lower than theoretical results. One of the reasons is that some elements affecting the efficiency, such as pressure losses in evaporator, condenser and pipes, have not been deeply discussed and optimized. The present manuscript detailed and examined the influences of pressure losses on ORC thermodynamic efficiency. Pressure losses in ORC system were divided into three categories: High Pressure Loss of the first category (HPL1), High Pressure Loss of the second category (HPL2) and Low Pressure Loss (LPL). A formula was developed to describe the relationships between three categories of pressure losses and ORC thermodynamic efficiency. Through analyses of the formula, it is found that the adverse impacts of pressure losses on thermodynamic efficiency are very different, mainly depending on the characteristic specific volume of working fluid in certain state. Because the very different specific volume, under a same value of pressure loss, LPL mostly leads to the largest thermodynamic efficiency drop of ORC system, HPL1 does less and HPL2 does the least. The influences of LPL are normally 3-21 times larger than that of HPL1, and 30-50 times larger than that of HPL2. The conclusions will serve as a guide for engineering applications of ORC system.

AB Most research published into stand-alone energy systems, hybridised by supplementing PV with combustion based prime movers, considers meeting an electric load demand. This paper goes further by studying the role of both electric and heating loads on the optimisation of hybridised stand-alone Combined Heating and Power (CHP) systems. The role of both the load following strategy in these systems (electric only FEL, versus electric and thermal FEL/FTL) as well as the relative magnitude of the heating load is analysed on system cost and performance. The conceptual CHP systems modelled also consider waste system derived from either multiple Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) or Micro Gas Turbines (MGTs). The research uses MATLAB-based Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimisation throughout and features detailed hardware characteristics as well as temporally fluctuating meteorological (solar irradiance, temperature) and load (electric, heating) data. The outcomes are also tested in relation to CHP systems sized whilst optimising either single (Cost of Energy-COE, $/kW h) or multiple functions (COE and overall system efficiency, eta(CHP),%).
   Results indicate that whilst the power management strategy used in CHP systems (FEL or FEL/FTL) has minimal effects on the COE, it can appreciably affect other performance indicators. For example, in CHP systems sized based on FEL/FTL, whilst COE = similar to 0.20 $/kW h the resulting eta(CHP) is 66% for PV/Bat/ICE and 44% for PV/Bat/MGT. This is compared to using a PMS of the FEL type which results in similar COE = similar to 0.21 $/kW h but with eta(CHP) = 50% in PV/Bat/ICE systems and 34% in PV/Bat/MGT. In relation to overall environmental impact expressed though Life Cycle Emission-LCE (kg CO2-eq/yr) when heating demand is around 50% of the electric (Electric to Thermal Load Ratio = 60:40), a PMS of the FEL/FTL results in up to 30% lower LCE compared to those with FEL in some CHP systems.

AB In this paper, a methodology is presented to find the optimal size, location and technology of distributed generation (DG) units considering economic, technical, and environmental issues simultaneously. This technique can be implemented to both renewable and nonrenewable DGs. From economic perspective, minimizing cost and maximizing profit are investigated separately and compared with each other. In addition, from technical and environmental viewpoints, a complete set of indices are defined. In order to find the optimal solution, multiobjective particle swarm optimization, and fuzzy decision-making techniques are utilized. Furthermore, to evaluate the proposed method more accurately, two scenarios are defined. In fact, the first scenario, which is only based on cost minimization and technical objective functions, plays an introductory role for better comprehension of the second scenario. In the second scenario, which includes the presentation of the methodologies of this paper, the effect of selecting either profitmaximization or cost minimization as an economic objective function along with the minimization of technical and environmental objective functions are precisely investigated. By carrying out the simulations on the IEEE 33-bus distribution test system, it is concluded that the cost-based framework is not the most profitable one, whereas the profit-based one may well lead to a more appropriate result from economic viewpoints.

AB Wide area measurement system (WAMS) usually contains three dependent infrastructures called management, measurement, and communication. For optimal operation of a power system, it is necessary to design these infrastructures suitably. In this paper, measurement and communication infrastructures in a wide area network are designed independently from a management viewpoint, considering an adequate level of system observability. In the first step, optimal placement of measurement devices is determined using an integer linear programming (ILP) solution methodology while taking into account zero-injection bus effects. In the next step, new dynamic multiobjective shortest path (MOSP) programming is presented for the optimal design of communication infrastructure. The best architecture design is introduced in terms of optical fiber power ground wire (OPGW) coverage for the suggested central control bus and the number of phasor measurement units (PMUs). The applicability of the proposed model is finally examined on several IEEE standard test systems. The simulation results show better performance of the proposedmethod compared with other conventional methods. The numerical results reveal that applying the proposed method could not only reduce the OPGW coverage cost, the number of PMUs, and the number of communication links but could also improve the system technical indexes such as latency as subsidiary results of the optimization process.

AB In modern optical networks, infrastructure management is faced with the challenge of using expensive equipment and communication resources as efficiently as possible. This now includes keeping power consumption costs at a minimum and using the available optical links in a balanced way, in addition to the traditional goals of providing the best possible performance to the end customers while meeting their quality requirements. Accordingly, this paper presents a heuristic single-step lightpath routing and wavelength assignment algorithm, handling online dynamic connection requests within a fully distributed network control plane. By using shortest path routing, the presented scheme determines the best compromise solution between the users' and carrier's objectives. The former can be mainly expressed in terms of connection QoS requirements, while the latter comprises network engineering (distributing the load in order to achieve near-optimum resource usage) and containing energy consumption. This approach is able to find, in a polynomial computing time, a multiobjective optimization solution that maximizes the carriers' return of investment and supports a high number of users' request while drastically reducing the network operational expenditures, as extensively demonstrated through a simulation.

AB In software testing, optimal testing resource allocation problems (OTRAPs) are importantwhen seeking a good tradeoff between reliability, cost, and time with limited resources. There have been intensive studies of OTRAPs using multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), but little attention has been paid to the constraint handling. This paper comprehensively investigates the effect of the constraint handling on the performance of nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) for solving OTRAPs, from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. The heuristics for individual repairs are first proposed to handle constraint violations in NSGA-II, based on which several properties are derived. Additionally, the Z-score based Euclidean distance is adopted to estimate the difference between solutions. Finally, the above methods are evaluated and the experiments show several results. 1) The developed heuristics for constraint handling are better than the Existing Strategy in terms of the capacity and coverage values. 2) The Z-score operation obtains better diversity values and reduces repeated solutions. 3) The modified NSGA-II for OTRAPs (called NSGA-II-TRA) performs significantly better than the existing MOEAs in terms of capacity and coverage values, which suggests that NSGA-II-TRA could obtain more and higher quality testing-time-allocation schemes, especially for large, complex datasets. 4) NSGA-II-TRA is robust according to the sensitivity analysis results.

AB Mobility management is one of the most important operations in any public land mobile network. For idle terminals, most of mobility management strategies consist of two main procedures: subscriber's location update and paging. These two procedures define a multiobjective optimization problem in which the challenge is to find the network configurations that minimize the number of location updates and the number of paging messages. In this optimization process, the use of accurate information is very important to find the network configurations that best match the subscribers' activity in a mobile network. A mobile activity trace is a very accurate way for representing the subscribers' activity in a mobile network in form of a chronological list of events related to the subscribers' movements and the incoming and outgoing calls. This kind of representation can be used to study the performance of any mobility management strategy at the expense of considerably increasing the time needed to evaluate the objective functions. In fact, we show that more than 99% of the optimizer runtime is used to evaluate the objective functions. With the aim of facing this problem, we propose a fine-grained parallel approach focused on parallelizing the objective functions exclusively. Results show that the efficiency of our approach is always higher than 50% and that the optimizer runtime is drastically reduced.

AB Multiobjective optimization (MOO), which accounts for several distinct, possibly conflicting, objectives, is expected to be capable of providing improved reservoir-management (RM) solutions for efficient oilfield development because of the overall optimization of subsurface flow. Considering the complexity and diversity of MOO problems in model-based RM, we develop three MOO methods-MOAdjoint, MOGA, and MOPSO-in this work to address various oilfield-development problems. MOAdjoint combines a weighted-sum technique with a gradient-based method for solving large-scale continuous problems that have thousands of variables. An adjoint method is used to efficiently compute the derivatives of objective functions with respect to decision variables, and a sequential quadratic-programming method is used for optimization search. MOGA is a population-based method, which combines a Pareto-ranking technique with genetic algorithm (GA) to address small-scale (discrete) problems. MOPSO is another population-based method, which combines a Pareto technique with particle-swarm optimization (PSO) for a wide spectrum of optimization problems. Their advantages and disadvantages are highlighted. To take advantage of the strengths and overcome the drawbacks of these methods, a multiscale hybrid strategy is further formulated for solving complex, large-scale optimization problems by combining these methods at various scales. An example is used to compare these methods. Results show that all three methods can yield improved solutions. MOPSO seems particularly suitable for medium-scale RM problems, mainly because of its relatively fast convergence speed and efficient recovery of the Pareto front. With a proper initial guess and a set of effective weight coefficients, MOAdjoint can most efficiently solve large-scale continuous problems, particularly if model uncertainty is considered. The multiscale hybrid strategy is able to offer the best result.

AB Selection is a major driving force behind evolution and is a key feature of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. Selection aims at promoting the survival and reproduction of individuals that are most fitted to a given environment. In the presence of multiple objectives, major challenges faced by this operator come from the need to address both the population convergence and diversity, which are conflicting to a certain extent. This paper proposes a new selection scheme for evolutionary multiobjective optimization. Its distinctive feature is a similarity measure for estimating the population diversity, which is based on the angle between the objective vectors. The smaller the angle, the more similar individuals. The concept of similarity is exploited during the mating by defining the neighborhood and the replacement by determining the most crowded region where the worst individual is identified. The latter is performed on the basis of a convergence measure that plays a major role in guiding the population towards the Pareto optimal front. The proposed algorithm is intended to exploit strengths of decomposition-based approaches in promoting diversity among the population while reducing the user's burden of specifying weight vectors before the search. The proposed approach is validated by computational experiments with state-of-the-art algorithms on problems with different characteristics. The obtained results indicate a highly competitive performance of the proposed approach. Significant advantages are revealed when dealing with problems posing substantial difficulties in keeping diversity, including many-objective problems. The relevance of the suggested similarity and convergence measures are shown. The validity of the approach is also demonstrated on engineering problems.

AB This paper proposes a modified cuckoo search algorithm (MCSA) for solving multi-objective short-term fixed head hydrothermal scheduling (HTS) problem. The main objective of the multiobjective HTS problem is to minimize both total power generation cost and emission of thermal generators over a scheduling period while satisfying power balance, hydraulic, and generator operating limit constraints. The proposed MCSA method is developed for the problem based on improvements from the conventional CSA method which is a new metaheuristic algorithm inspired from the behavior of some cuckoo species laying their egg into the nest of other species to improve the optimal solution and speed up the computational process. In the MCSA method, the nests are evaluated and classified into two groups including the top group with better quality eggs and the abandoned group with worse quality eggs. Two effective strategies via Levy flights for producing new solutions are applied to the abandoned and top groups. To validate the efficiency of the MCSA method, several test systems have been tested and the result comparisons from the test systems have indicated that the proposed method can obtain higher quality solution and shorter computational time than many other methods. Therefore, the proposed MCSA method can be new efficient method for solving multiobjective short-term fixed-head HTS problems.

AB Selection of promising assets and allocating capital among them is a crucial part of the financial decision making process. Modern portfolio theory formulated it as a quadratic optimization problem of maximizing expected returns and minimizing the risk of the portfolio. This problem was modified to incorporate investor's preferences resulting in discrete non-linear search space which cannot be handled by traditional quadratic programming approaches. Relevant literature shows the success of evolutionary algorithms in modelling some of these preferences Multi-criteria algorithms for portfolio optimization under practical constraintsin a constrained optimization problem. This study proposes a candidate generation procedure and a repair mechanism for practical portfolio optimization model in multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) settings. Both these methods together can handle a larger class of constraints namely cardinality, pre assignment, budget, quantity (floor and ceiling) and round-lot constraints. Proposed methods can easily be incorporated into existing evolutionary algorithms. To evaluate their effectiveness, four MOEAs namely Non dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II), Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2), Global Weighting Achievement Scalarizing Function Genetic Algorithm (GWASFGA) and Pareto Envelope-based Selection Algorithm-II (PESA-II) have been adapted and their capability of approximating unconstrained efficient frontier are discussed. For empirical testing, seven datasets involving maximum up to 1290 assets are used. All 'the adapted algorithms are compared and evaluated on the basis of five well-known performance metrics for MORAs. The potential of our adapted algorithms is presented in comparison with existing MOEAs for the identical problems.

AB Reduction of leakages in water distribution systems (WDSs) is one of the major concerns for water industries. This paper presents a leakage reduction technique using pressure management by optimizing the water level in storage tanks, along with optimized control and localization of pressurereducing valves (PRVs) in WDSs. A new mathematical tank and pump simulation algorithm is presented for controlling pressure in WDSs, by optimizing the water storage level in the tank depending upon the demand variations. The tank is used as a decision variable for the leakage reduction model. A modified reference pressure algorithm is introduced for improving PRV localization. A multiobjective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used to find the optimized operational control setting of the PRV for leakage minimization. The proposed algorithm leads to a leakage reduction of 26.51% in Anytown WDS and 20.81% in a modified benchmark WDS. This technique leads to an appreciable reduction in leakage rate, with fewer PRVs required, taking into account constraints such as maintaining a lower hydraulic failure index (< 0.01), emergency storage, etc. It can be concluded that the proposed novel leakage reduction technique provides a more cost effective and efficient solution for leakage control.

AB Given a multivariate time series, possibly of high dimension, with unknown and time-varying joint distribution, it is of interest to be able to completely partition the time series into disjoint, contiguous subseries, each of which has different distributional or pattern attributes from the preceding and succeeding subseries. An additional feature of many time series is that they display self-affinity, so that subseries at one time scale are similar to subseries at another after application of an affine transformation. Such qualities are observed in time series from many disciplines, including biology, medicine, economics, finance, and computer science. This paper defines the relevant multiobjective combinatorial optimization problem with limited assumptions as a biobjective one, and a specialized evolutionary algorithm is presented which finds optimal self-affine time series partitionings with a minimum of choice parameters. The algorithm not only finds partitionings for all possible numbers of partitions given data constraints, but also for self-affinities between these partitionings and some fine-grained partitioning. The resulting set of Pareto-efficient solution sets provides a rich representation of the self-affine properties of a multivariate time series at different locations and time scales.

AB Support vector machines (SVMs) are among the most powerful learning algorithms for classification tasks. However, these algorithms require a high computational cost during the training phase, which can limit their application on large-scale datasets. Moreover, it is known that their effectiveness highly depends on the hyper-parameters used to train the model. With the intention of dealing with these, this paper introduces an evolutionary multiobjective model and instance selection (IS) approach for SVMs with Pareto-based ensemble, whose goals are, precisely, to optimize the size of the training set and the classification performance attained by the selection of the instances, which can be done using either a wrapper or a filter approach. Due to the nature of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, several Pareto optimal solutions can be found. We study several ways of using such information to perform a classification task. To accomplish this, our proposal performs a processing over the Pareto solutions in order to combine them into a single ensemble. This is done in five different ways, which are based on: 1) a global Pareto ensemble; 2) error reduction; 3) a complementary error reduction; 4) maximized margin distance; and 5) boosting. Through a comprehensive experimental study we evaluate the suitability of the proposed approach and the Pareto processing, and we show its advantages over a singleobjective formulation, traditional IS techniques, and learning algorithms.

AB The deployment of the airships plays a key role in maximizing the performance of the near space communication system. The main problem is how to strike a balance between the conflicting network speed and coverage for complex user distribution. In this paper, we propose a multiobjective deployment optimization model considering path loss, user demand, and inner structure. Under the framework of the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) based on decomposition (MOEA/D), we propose a similarity-based MOEA to optimize this problem. The proposed algorithm is motivated by the population's perception on the decision variable space. The proposed algorithm perceives the decision variable space by deploying airships to latent regions. The perceptions of different solutions are related by the similarity between their deployments and utilized differently by crossover and mutation. The proposed algorithm is tested on five designed problems compared with MOEA/D with the other popular reproduction operators. We also test the proposed scheme integrated with another two popular algorithms. The experimental results show that the similarity-based MOEA/D outperforms the other algorithms significantly in detecting hotspots, tracking multiple hotspots and safely deploying airships for most cases. The proposed scheme also works well with the other algorithms.

AB Computationally expensive multiobjective optimization problems are difficult to solve using solely evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and require surrogate models, such as the Kriging model. To solve such problems efficiently, we propose infill criteria for appropriately selecting multiple additional sample points for updating the Kriging model. These criteria correspond to the expected improvement of the penaltybased boundary intersection (PBI) and the inverted PBI. These PBI-based measures are increasingly applied to EAs due to their ability to explore better nondominated solutions than those that are obtained by the Tchebycheff function. In order to add sample points uniformly in the multiobjective space, we assign territories and niche counts to uniformly distributed weight vectors for evaluating the proposed criteria. We investigate these criteria in various test problems and compare them with established infill criteria for multiobjective surrogate-based optimization. Both proposed criteria yield better diversity and convergence than those obtained with other criteria for most of the test problems.

AB The existing multiobjective expected improvement (EI) criteria are often computationally expensive because they are calculated using multivariate piecewise integrations, the number of which increases exponentially with the number of objectives. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a new approach to develop cheap-to-evaluate multiobjective EI criteria based on the proposed EI matrix (EIM). The elements in the EIM are the single-objective EIs that the studying point has beyond each Pareto front approximation point in each objective. Three multiobjective criteria are developed by combining the elements in the EIM into scalar functions in three different ways. These proposed multiobjective criteria are calculated using only 1-D integrations, whose number increases linearly with respect to the number of objectives. Moreover, all the three criteria are derived in closed form expressions, thus are significantly cheaper to evaluate than the state-of-the-art multiobjective criteria. The efficiencies of the proposed criteria are validated through 12 test problems. Besides the computational advantage, the proposed multiobjective EI criteria also show competitive abilities in approximating the Pareto fronts of the chosen test problems compared against the state-of-the-art multiobjective EI criteria.

AB Many real-world classification systems must comply with a series of inherent restrictions to the problem at hand such as response times, power consumptions or computational costs. This poses a fundamental limitation to traditional performance-driven classifiers and learning algorithms by restraining their applicability in cost-sensitive scenarios. Because of this, fuzzy systems are leveraged to learn cost-conscious multi-stage classifiers through multiobjective optimization to find a set of optimal tradeoffs between accuracy and any related cost. This approach allows to find a suitable balance between all objectives regardless of the scenario. Experimental evaluations were done for Sound Environment Classification in modern battery-powered hearing aids by jointly optimising classification accuracy and computational costs.

AB The study describes a multi-objective optimization algorithm for an innovative integration of forced ventilated PV-PCM modules in glazed facade buildings: the aim is to identify and optimize the parameters that most affect thermal and energy performances. 1-D model, finite difference method FDM, thermal resistances technique and enthalpy method were applied to describe different facade solutions and transient thermal performance of PCM. The coupling between the PV-PCM facade code implemented in MATLAB and the TRNSYS software was developed to estimate the dynamic thermal energy profiles. An exploratory step has also been considered prior to the optimization algorithm: it evaluates the energy profiles before and after the application of PCM to PV module integrated in glazed building. The optimization analysis investigate parameters such as ventilation flow rates and time schedule to obtain the best combination suiting the PCM performance and external-internal loads. A group of solution were identified on the Pareto front. Savings in thermal loads for the best individual reached 26.4% while the best in temperature increment in operating temperatures was recorded as 6.8% comparing to the design set temperature.

AB Both cooling and thermal insulation can be achieved using a triple-glazed skylight filled with a gas that absorbs and emits thermal radiation. Utilizing radiative cooling as the driving force a cooling effect can be achieved in the here outlined skylight, while it can also act as a thermal insulator when desired.
   Inside the skylight the gas it contains circulates by natural convection induced by its heated lower compartment to the radiatively cooled upper compartment that "sees" the sky. By this circulation, cooling is obtained to a room located below the skylight. When this circulation is cut off, the skylight acts as a thermal insulator. This gives a multi-objective optimization problem, as these two objectives are conflicting.
   In this article, a Pareto front is created that shows possible trade-off solutions between the cooling and insulating properties of the designed skylight. This Pareto front is created by optimizing the dimensions of the skylight. Thus, the skylight will provide an optimal cooling effect and an optimal insulation effect when needed.

AB The present paper focuses on machining (turning) aspects of CFRP (epoxy) composites by using single point HSS cutting tool. The optimal setting i.e. the most favourable combination of process parameters (such as spindle speed, feed rate, depth of cut and fibre orientation angle) has been derived in view of multiple and conflicting requirements of machining performance yields viz. material removal rate, surface roughness, SR (of the turned product) and cutting force. This study initially derives mathematical models (objective functions) by using statistics of nonlinear regression for correlating various process parameters with respect to the output responses. In the next phase, the study utilizes a recently developed advanced optimization algorithm teaching-learning based optimization (TLBO) in order to determine the optimal machining condition for achieving satisfactory machining performances. Application potential of TLBO algorithm has been compared to that of genetic algorithm (GA). It has been observed that exploration of TLBO appears more fruitful in contrast to GA in the context of this case experimental research focused on machining of CFRP composites.

AB Recently, multi- and many-objective meta-heuristic algorithms have received considerable attention due to their capability to solve optimization problems that require more than one fitness function. This paper presents a comprehensive study of these techniques applied in the context of machine learning problems. Three different topics are reviewed in this work: (a) feature extraction and selection, (b) hyper-parameter optimization and model selection in the context of supervised learning, and (c) clustering or unsupervised learning. The survey also highlights future research towards related areas.

AB The optimal allocation of crop area can improve the management of agricultural water resources for sustaining agricultural productivity and sustainable development. In this study, an approach that integrated the multiobjective optimization model with an orthogonal experimental design was developed for decision makers to choose the optimal crop area under limited water and land resources. The approach was developed in three stages-(1) preparation stage; (2) calculation stage; and (3) decision-making stage-and included five steps: (1) data collection; (2) establishment of an optimal model; (3) orthogonal experimental design; (4) screening; and (5) decision making. The agricultural drought degree, which can reflect the drought conditions of the irrigation district, was introduced to the established model in Step 2 as a social objective. Furthermore, a village called Qu, which is part of the Yellow River water irrigation district and is located in the southwest of Puyang city, Henan province, China, was taken as an example to demonstrate the approach.

AB Contaminant intrusion into water distribution networks can have disastrous consequences. This event poses a threat to public health and could result in political instability and social problems. After the contaminant and its source are detected, the main issues are consequences management and contaminant withdrawal from the water distribution network. To do this, several actions are required, including containing contaminant spread by closing valves and opening hydrants to flush out the polluted water. These actions may lead the network to a critical state in which the pressure of some nodes falls below the standard measure. In these network conditions, a pressure driven analysis of the water distribution network would be necessary. In this study, a combination of hydraulic simulation based on pressure driven analysis and particle swarm optimization is used to minimize the negative effects of contaminated water on public health as an immediate response after the contaminant entrance into water is detected. Based on the type of contaminant, two different emergency response strategies are introduced. Multiobjective optimization is performed when a nonharmful contaminant has entered the network. In this case, the main objectives are to minimize the impacts of contaminated water on consumers and the cost of operations. In another response strategy, reducing the time the network requires to return to a normal state is the objective of single-objective optimization when the contaminant is harmful. The proposed model was applied on the water distribution network of Sabzevar in northeastern Iran. The results proved the model's credibility and its applicability in real water distribution networks, even in cases of contaminant intrusion. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB In this article, we attempt to understand and to contrast the impact of problem features on the performance of randomized search heuristics for black-box multiobjective combinatorial optimization problems. At first, we measure the performance of two conventional dominance-based approaches with unbounded archive on a benchmark of enumerable binary optimization problems with tunable ruggedness, objective space dimension, and objective correlation (rho MNK-landscapes). Precisely, we investigate the expected runtime required by a global evolutionary optimization algorithm with an ergodic variation operator (GSEMO) and by a neighborhood-based local search heuristic (PLS), to identify a (1 + epsilon)-approximation of the Pareto set. Then, we define a number of problem features characterizing the fitness landscape, and we study their intercorrelation and their association with algorithm runtime on the benchmark instances. At last, with a mixed-effects multilinear regression we assess the individual and joint effect of problem features on the performance of both algorithms, within and across the instance classes defined by benchmark parameters. Our analysis reveals further insights into the importance of ruggedness and multimodality to characterize instance hardness for this family of multiobjective optimization problems and algorithms.

AB Inconel 718 is widely used in high-temperature environments, high-performance aircraft, and hypersonic missile weapon systems; however, it is very difficult to machine using conventional techniques. This study employed an L9 Taguchi orthogonal array for the analysis of wire electrical discharge machining parameters when used for the machining of Inconel 718. Our aim was to determine the optimal combination of parameters to minimize surface roughness while maximizing the material removal rate. The Taguchi method is widely applied in mechanical engineering with the aim of identifying the optimal combination of processing parameters as they pertain to single quality characteristics. Unfortunately, Taguchi analysis often leads to contradictory results when seeking to rectify multiple objectives. To resolve this issue, this study implemented gray relational analysis in conjunction with Taguchi method to obtain the optimal combination of parameters to deal specifically with multiple quality objectives. For the dual objectives of surface roughness and material removal rate, the optimal combination of parameters derived using gray relational analysis resulted in a mean surface roughness of 2.75 mu m. In L9 orthogonal array experiments, run 1 produced the best gray relational grade with mean surface roughness of 2.80 mu m, representing an improvement of 1.8%. The material removal rate achieved after the application of gray relational analysis was 0.00190 g/s, whereas the L9 experiment achieved a material removal rate of 0.00123 g/s, representing an improvement of 54.5%.

AB To improve the accuracy of five-axis machine tool with a swiveling head, an approach for optimizing compensation values taking into account the sensitivity of position-independent geometric error is proposed in this paper. At first, the synthetic volumetric error model of five-axis machine tool has been established with homogeneous transformation method and multibody system theory, which describes the effect of geometric error components on position and orientation error vector intuitively. Second, the probability distributions of geometric errors in workspace of machine tool are sufficiently taken into account in order to overcome the defects of the analysis at certain locations, and then, global quantitative sensitivity analysis is introduced for determining the effect of each geometric error on precision of machine tool. Next, the optimum values are obtained by multiobjective quality loss and precision robustness trade-offs based on archive-based microgenetic algorithm (AMGA) for geometric error compensation. Finally, the geometric error compensation experiments were carried out, and the results show that the accuracy of measuring trajectories are improved significantly, which reaches 73.7% after error compensation with optimum values based on sensitivity analysis. Hence, the proposed methodology of analysis and compensation are effective for analyzing the effect of geometric errors and improving the precision of machine tool.

AB In order to solve the problems of high cost and low efficiency in milling of titanium alloy, multiobjective optimizations are proposed to optimize machining and ultrasonic parameters by nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). In the present work, longitudinal-torsion ultrasonic vibration has been superimposed to the milling of titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V). Orthogonal experiment of milling has been carried out to evaluate influence of the parameters on machining results. Then, to meet the different engineering demands, three multiobjective optimization models are established to obtain optimization parameters. According to the optimization results, a group of milling verified experiments was developed for optimized models. The results show that the three optimization models balance the different objective well, and the optimization results are close to experiment results. It provides choices for engineering application.

AB Multi-objective optimization of simulated stochastic systems aims at estimating a representative set of Pareto optimal solutions and a common approach is to rely on metamodels to alleviate computational costs of the optimization process. In this article, both the objective and constraint functions are assumed to be smooth, highly non-linear and computationally expensive and are emulated by stochastic Kriging models. Then a novel global optimization algorithm, combing the expected hypervolume improvement of approximated Pareto front and the probability of feasibility of new points, is proposed to identify the Pareto front (set) with a minimal number of expensive simulations. The algorithm is suitable for the situations of having disconnected feasible regions and of having no feasible solution in initial design. Then, we also quantify the variability of estimated Pareto front caused by the intrinsic uncertainty of stochastic simulation using nonparametric bootstrapping method to better support decision making. One test function and an (s, S) inventory system experiment illustrate the potential and efficiency of the proposed sequential optimization algorithm for constrained multi-objective optimization problems in stochastic simulation, which is especially useful in Operations Research and Management Science.

AB Productivity can be improved in machining by achieving higher material removal rate (MRR) and better surface finish at lower power consumption along with higher tool life. Present work focuses on analyzing power consumption, material removal rate; surface roughness and tool wear in high speed milling of Ti-6Al-4V using response surface methodology. Models are developed with experimental data measured after performing face milling operation sequentially using design of experiments. Developed models are validated and reformed using Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and stepwise backward elimination method. Developed models showed correlation coefficient (R (2)) more than 95% which means models can best explain the experimental data. Further, multiobjective optimization is performed to minimize power consumption; surface roughness and tool wear as well as to maximize MRR using response optimizer with desirability approach. Optimum process parameters obtained are: cutting speed = 133.5 m/min, feed rate = 0.14 mm/tooth and depth of cut = 2.33 mm. Validation of optimized results is done with three confirmation experiments at the optimum conditions and the responses are taken as average of the three confirmation experiments. Additionally, Pareto optimal points are found for conflicting objective functions using multiobjective genetic algorithm.

AB The aim of this paper is to address new approaches, in separate ways, to necessary and, respectively, sufficient optimality conditions in constrained vector optimization. In this respect, for the necessary optimality conditions that we derive, we use a kind of vectorial penalization technique, while for the sufficient optimality conditions we make use of an appropriate scalarization method. In both cases, the approaches couple a basic technique (of penalization or scalarization, respectively) with several results in variational analysis and optimization obtained by the authors in the last years. These combinations allow us to arrive to optimality conditions which are, in terms of assumptions made, new.

AB In this paper a novel approach is proposed for optimization of electrically serial two-stage thermoelectric refrigeration systems using a chemical reaction optimization algorithm (CRO). In order to investigate the performance of the proposed method, a full computer code was developed and two different test cases with different situations were solved by it to show the accuracy and efficiency of the method. Cooling capacity and coefficient of performance of the thermoelectric refrigeration system are considered as objective functions of the optimization process. The results of the research are compared to those obtained by literature approaches, including analytical and optimization algorithms. The effects of the joint thermal resistance at the interface of the two stages on objective functions in all of the case studies also were studied and sensitivity analysis of COP and cooling capacity of the system to this parameter is conducted. The obtained results showed improvement of the objective functions using the CRO method in comparison to the methods used previously for optimization of the considered refrigeration system. The outlined results revealed that the CRO algorithm can be successfully employed for optimal design of new systems and performance optimization of existence two-stage thermoelectric refrigeration system.

AB Installing Internal Heat Exchanger (IHE) after the turbine, can increase the effectiveness of heat exchange process and consequently plant efficiency in the Organic Rankin Cycles (ORCs). The main objective of this study is to investigate and also compare the energy, economic and environmental issues for two different configurations of geothermal binary cycles including conventional ORC and ORC with Internal Heat Exchanger (IHE-ORC). Energy-Economic-Environment (3E) models for both cycles were developed and a parametric study was conducted with respect to the maximum thermodynamic efficiencies and minimum cost rate. Evaporator pressure, superheating degree of the steam, the minimum pinch difference temperature in the evaporator and also condenser temperature were analyzed to obtain the optimal performance of the system. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of IHE in binary cycles on the exergy destruction rates for all components and finding the most sensitive equipment to IHE. The results indicated that under optimized economic conditions, IHE-ORC had higher net power output (5245 vs. 5063 kW) with lower production cost. Furthermore, IHE-ORC, had superior energy and exergy efficiencies (16.82%, 59.71% vs. 14.13%, 52.2%). Additionally, IHE system was more environmental friendly and in comparison with conventional ORC, it can save the fuel consumption by 3.6% higher value and consequently about 3.6% reduces the CO2 emission more than conventional ORC.

AB The interests in multiobjective and many-objective optimization have been rapidly increasing in the evolutionary computation community. However, most studies on multiobjective and many-objective optimization are limited to small-scale problems, despite the fact that many real-world multiobjective and many-objective optimization problems may involve a large number of decision variables. As has been evident in the history of evolutionary optimization, the development of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for solving a particular type of optimization problems has undergone a co-evolution with the development of test problems. To promote the research on large-scale multiobjective and many-objective optimization, we propose a set of generic test problems based on design principles widely used in the literature of multiobjective and many-objective optimization. In order for the test problems to be able to reflect challenges in real-world applications, we consider mixed separability between decision variables and nonuniform correlation between decision variables and objective functions. To assess the proposed test problems, six representative evolutionary multiobjective and many-objective EAs are tested on the proposed test problems. Our empirical results indicate that although the compared algorithms exhibit slightly different capabilities in dealing with the challenges in the test problems, none of them are able to efficiently solve these optimization problems, calling for the need for developing new EAs dedicated to large-scale multiobjective and many-objective optimization.

AB Evolutionary multiobjective optimization in dynamic environments is a challenging task, as it requires the optimization algorithm converging to a time-variant Pareto optimal front. This paper proposes a dynamic multiobjective optimization algorithm which utilizes an inverse model set to guide the search toward promising decision regions. In order to reduce the number of fitness evalutions for change detection purpose, a two-stage change detection test is proposed which uses the inverse model set to check potential changes in the objective function landscape. Both static and dynamic multiobjective benchmark optimization problems have been considered to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results show that the improvement in optimization performance is achievable when the proposed inverse model set is adopted.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM
AB We consider an analytical model of a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) and formulate a mixed-integer constrained multiobjective optimization problem with six objective functions. We demonstrate the usefulness of solving such a problem by applying an interactive multiobjective optimization method called NIMBUS. In the NIMBUS method, a decision is iteratively involved in the optimization process and directs the solution process in order to find the most preferred Pareto optimal solution for the problem. We also employ a commonly used non-interactive evolutionary multiobjective optimization method called NSGA-II to generate a set of solutions that approximate the Pareto set and demonstrate the advantages of using an interactive method. This study is the first one to consider an interactive approach for the design of a PMSG. Thus, we promote the further usage of interactive multiobjective optimization methods in the design. Further, we see that these methods could also be very useful in the teaching of electrical machines.

AB Using advanced constitutive models in simulation tools can improve predictive capabilities of automotive structures in crashworthiness applications. This work presents the influences of coupling anisotropic yield functions into the size optimization of extruded front rails to maximize energy absorption characteristics. Finite element simulations of the extrusion crush response are performed using the von Mises (1913), Hosford (1972) and Barlat et al. (2005) Y1d2004-18p yield functions. Each yield function is implemented into a 2-dimensional plane stress and 3-dimensional element formulation to highlight the modeling differences prior to optimization. The simulations are also compared to the experimental dynamic crush response of the extrusion. The response surface methodology (RSM) with the artificial neural network (ANN) metamodeling technique is coupled with the genetic algorithm (GA) optimization scheme to improve the specific energy absorption (SEA) through maximizing energy absorption and minimizing mass. A constrained and unconstrained mass optimization study is performed to identify the sensitivity of global optimization to yield surface choice. Analytical models are derived to explain the influence of the yield surface on the convergence of optimization. The results highlight the importance of incorporating anisotropic yield functions into the optimization process. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In order to help manufacturing companies to quantify product carbon footprints and provide carbon emission data in a job shop for future life cycle product carbon labelling, a calculating method of product carbon footprint in a job shop is proposed. The carbon emissions in a job shop are allocated to each product based on mapping relations between resources and products consuming the resources. To reduce product carbon footprints in a job shop, a multi-objective optimization model aimed at minimizing carbon footprints of all products and makespan is proposed. In order to solve the proposed model and explore the performance of Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (FOA) in multi-objective scheduling optimization problems, a Hybrid Fruit fly optimization algorithm (HFOA) is designed. The proposed model and algorithm are verified by a case study. It is to provide decision makers awareness of carbon footprints for each product in a job shop and the product carbon footprint in job shops can be further used to calculate life cycle product carbon labelling.

AB We propose a processing alternative for replacing the traditional and environmentally dangerous solvents (as monoethanolamine, diethanolamine) in the process of CO(2 )capture. We use a computer aided molecular design methodology for exploring the use of ionic liquids as solvents for CO2 capture. The optimization formulation is solved as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, the objective is to obtain an optimal molecular structure of a particular class of ionic liquids for CO2 capture from a post-combustion gas stream. We use a subset of functional groups and anions, whose combination forms only certain kind of ILs that have the potential to solubilize CO2 and remove it from gas streams. The properties of ILs are estimated by group contributions methods and the equilibrium behaviour by empirical correlations. Moreover, recognizing the strong interactions between ionic liquids design and the processing system deployed to carried out the separation, a simultaneous optimal product and process design is also proposed. Moreover, we also propose a multiobjective optimization framework to deal with conflicting design objectives related to process economics and sustainability issues. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, a relatively new strategy known as unified optimization is applied to the cam profile optimization for the delivery system of an offset press by integrating the procedure of single objective optimization with ADAMS software. The proposed approach mainly consists of two parts that includes a single objective optimization procedure and a multibody dynamic model of cam-follower mechanism. For the procedure of single objective optimization, the design process starts from defining the follower acceleration profile by using a modified trapezoidal curve, then genetic algorithm is adopted to determine the evaluating indexes for the kinematic behavior of cam-follower mechanism in multiobjective optimization. Subsequently, sequential quadratic programming, which deals well with equality and inequality constrains, is selected as single objective optimized algorithm in this part. On the other hand, the dynamic simulation developed by ADAMS software is carried out to investigate the dynamic characteristics of cam-follower mechanism. Finally, an optimization cycle, also known as iterative process, is proposed to implement the procedure of single objective optimization and dynamic simulation alternately to improve the kinematic and dynamic characteristics of cam-follower mechanism fully. The cam profile optimization method presented in this paper provides a new tool for cam designers to avoid the undesirable impact and follower jump.

AB Recently the authors presented a single-agent Centralized Replicator Controller (CRC) and a decentralized Multi-Agent Replicator Controller (MARC) for vibration control of high-rise building structures. It was shown that the use of agents and a decentralized approach enhances the vibration control system. Two key parameters in the proposed control methodologies using replicator dynamics are the total population (total available resources or the sum of actuators forces) and the growth rate. In the previous research, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the appropriate values for the population size and growth rate. In this paper, the aforementioned control methodologies are integrated with a multi-objective optimization algorithm in order to find Pareto optimal values for growth rates with the goal of achieving maximum structural performance with minimum energy consumption. A modified neural dynamic model of Adeli and Park is used in this research to solve the many-objective optimization problem where the Normal Boundary Intersection method is employed to find Pareto optimality. Sample results are presented using a 20-story steel benchmark structure subjected to historical and artificial accelerograms.

AB Crashworthiness design for manufacturing of thin-walled structures remains a main challenge in vehicle industry. Conventionally, there have been two main stream procedures (1) conducting the crashworthiness optimization and manufacturing deign separately in a sequential manner; or (2) neglecting the effects of manufacturing process on final outcomes. Note that most of the energy absorbing members in vehicle body are fabricated by stamping process which likely results in non-uniform thickness, substantial residual strains/stresses especially for high strength steel or advanced high strength steels, etc. Furthermore, the uncertainties of the material properties, stamping process and geometry generally propagate from manufacturing phase to operational phase, likely leading to the uncontrollable fluctuations of crashing responses. In other words, a deterministic optimization could result in unreliable or unstable designs. To address these critical issues, a multiobjective reliability-based design optimization was proposed here to optimize the double-hat thin-walled structure by coupling with stamping uncertainties. First, the finite element analysis results of stamping process are transferred to crashworthiness simulation. As such the uncertainties of material properties, process parameters and resultant geometry can be propagated from forming stage to crashing stage in a non-deterministic context. Second, the surrogate modeling techniques were adopted to approximate the forming and crashing responses in terms of mean and standard deviation. Third, the multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm was employed to seek optimal reliable design solutions which were combined with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). The optimal results of the double-hat structure show that the proposed method not only significantly improved the formability and crashworthiness, but also was capable of enhancing the reliability of Pareto solutions.

AB This work proposes two novel optimization algorithms called Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) and Multiobjective Salp Swarm Algorithm (MSSA) for solving optimization problems with single and multiple objectives. The main inspiration of SSA and MSSA is the swarming behaviour of salps when navigating and foraging in oceans. These two algorithms are tested on several mathematical optimization functions to observe and confirm their effective behaviours in finding the optimal solutions for optimization problems. The results on the mathematical functions show that the SSA algorithm is able to improve the initial random solutions effectively and converge towards the optimum. The results of MSSA show that this algorithm can approximate Pareto optimal solutions with high convergence and coverage. The paper also considers solving several challenging and computationally expensive engineering design problems (e.g. airfoil design and marine propeller design) using SSA and MSSA. The results of the real case studies demonstrate the merits of the algorithms proposed in solving real-world problems with difficult and unknown search spaces. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A new computational framework is introduced for the automated finite element (FE) modeling of fiber reinforced composites and simulating their micromechanical behavior. The proposed methodology relies on a new microstructure reconstruction algorithm that implements the centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) to generate an initial uniform distribution of fibers with desired volume fraction and size distribution in a repeating unit cell of the composite. The genetic algorithm (GA) is then employed to optimize locations of fibers such that they replicate the target spatial arrangement. We also use a non-iterative mesh generation algorithm, named conforming to interface structured adaptive mesh refinement (CISAMR), to create FE models of the CFRPC. The CVT-GA-CISAMR framework is then employed to investigate the appropriate size of the composite's representative volume element. We also study the strength and failure mechanisms in the CFRPC subject to varying uniaxial and mixed-mode loadings.

AB In this study, the influence of ambient temperature is investigated on the performance of solar chimney. Dimensional analysis is performed to find the dimensionless variables for the purpose of predicting the solar chimney performance. A mathematical model was developed and validated with the experimental data of an experimental pilot. By using this model, it is shown that the ambient temperature has an adverse effect on the SCPP output. For this purpose, a solar chimney with 7.4 m chimney height, 0.6 m chimney diameter, 8 m collector diameter, and 0.2 m mean collector height was built. By using the Buckingham Pi theory, a dimensionless variable was obtained, and its value was correlated using the experimental data. The investigation of the system performance using this dimensionless variable shows that the output power increases with a third-order polynomial relation through increasing the size of SCPP, and with a linear relation through increasing the solar insolation. In the other word, when the size of the system and solar insolation increase, the output power of the solar chimney rises. The variation of the air velocity versus daytime shows maximum area from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.

AB In real-world applications, the optimization problems are usually subject to various constraints. To solve constrained optimization problems (COPs), this paper presents a new methodology, which incorporates a dynamic constraint handling mechanism into many-objective evolutionary optimization. Firstly we convert a COP into a dynamic constrained many-objective optimization problem (DCMaOP), which is equivalent to the COP, then the proposed many-objective optimization evolutionary algorithm with dynamic constraint handling, called MaDC, is realized to solve the DCMaOP. MaDC uses the differential evolution (DE) to generate individuals, and a reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach to select individuals. The effectiveness of MaDC is verified on 22 test instances. The experimental results show that MaDC is competitive to several state-of-the-art algorithms, and it has better global search ability than its peer algorithms.

AB The acquisition granularity (time feature quantity) and sampling span (spatial feature quantity) of the data are the feature factors to analyze the active power of renewable energy power stations. According to the time and space characteristics of photovoltaic (PV) power stations, the acquisition granularity and sampling span calibration methods of PV output power based on data mining technology are proposed this paper. The initial range of the acquisition granularity is determined by analyzing the maximum-order difference components of the PV output power. Through deeply mining the continuous change state of the PV output power, an acquisition granularity calibration method of the PV output power based on the multiobjective optimization model is proposed from time characteristics. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to solve the model to obtain the optimal the acquisition granularity of the PV power station. Through the analysis of the sample information entropy change trend of the PV output power, a sampling span calibration method of the PV output power based on the information entropy theory is proposed from space characteristics. The sensitivity analysis of the acquisition granularity and sampling span of the data to the capacity of energy storage systems is realized by the smooth control of the PV output power using first-order low filters. The simulation tests of the annual history operating data at a PV power station with the installed capacity of 40MW in China verify the validity of the provided methods. The simulation results show when the acquisition granularity takes 60seconds and the sampling span takes 33days, it can satisfy the accuracy of the required data of energy storage systems to realize the smooth control of the PV output power.

AB In case of a disaster such as an earthquake, one of the major problems encountered is rescuing the wounded from the rubble. They need to be transferred to clinics and hospitals for additional treatment. Given the critical situation after the event, some challenging decisions are to be made regarding the number and routing of relief transportation vehicles, assigning wounded people to available vehicles, and transferring the injured from crisis-stricken points to clinic centers. The principal issues addressed in this paper include (1) dealing with patients who are suffering from various injuries; (2) temporal limitations proportional to their injury level (transfer time window); (3) simultaneous access to ground and air lines of transport; and (4) the possibility of transferring patients with different levels of injury to the assigned clinics by one vehicle at the same time. This research introduces a multiobjective approach to identify the wounded, evacuation routes, and number of vehicles for evacuation planning. Through the application of a two-objective routing-allocation model, an attempt was made to reduce the total time of rescue operations and the total cost of preparing disaster-relief vehicles. Because the problem type was a nondeterministic polynomial-time-hard one, this paper applies the modified simulated annealing metaheuristic algorithm to solve the problem. Finally, in order to assess the applicability and efficiency of this algorithm, calculation time and objective function value are compared with the results obtained from software.

AB In designing the wings of UAVs, some factors such as the lift coefficient and lift-to-drag ratio (aerodynamic efficiency) play important roles in meeting the required fuel consumption, flight endurance, speed, reliability, maneuverability and runway length. One of the schemes presented for achieving the above objectives is the use of multi-element wings, in which high-lift mechanisms such as flaps and slats help the main airfoil. The recent advancements in the design of these mechanisms have made it possible to present a variety of morphing flap models that can perform adequately under different flight conditions. In the present research, a two-element wing model of a drone with medium-altitude and long-endurance capabilities and a morphing flap is numerically analyzed and the obtained results are compared with and validated by the empirical data obtained from wind tunnel tests. For optimizing the flap shape to achieve the maximum aerodynamic efficiency of the wing, the response surface method is used as a design of experiments technique. In this approach, several geometrical parameters that indicate the position and curvature of a flap were defined and different arrangements of these parameters are presented as experiment designs, then the aerodynamic efficiency of the wing for each design of experiment is determined numerically and the optimum design is proposed. The results show that the factors of flap curvature and vertical distance of flap to the main airfoil have a significant effect on the aerodynamic efficiency of the considered wing.

AB A self-blending method has been developed and applied to the modification of a bulbous bow. The method is capable of transforming ship hulls automatically. In this method, few representative number of cross sections (the key points of the cross sections) of the baseline geometry are selected. New cross sections are generated through merging the two cross sections next to each other, using a prescribed weight factor. Different weight factors are assigned to the x, y and z coordinates of the key points of the cross section. The method thus can be one, two or three parameters self-blending method. The surface of the ship hull generated through the method is smooth so that it can be readily used for meshing and CFD (computational fluid dynamics) applications. Combined with CFD and DOE (design of experiment) techniques the shape of bulbous bow of a fishing vessel is optimized and the resistance is reduced by 2%.

AB Hot climate countries require large amounts of desalinated water. The Reverse osmosis (RO) technique is currently considered the most reliable technique for brackish water and seawater desalination. However, its power consumption is considerably higher than all other techniques. Therefore, the present study investigates the performance of reverse osmosis plants in hot climate conditions. A typical Reverse osmosis system was designed, constructed and investigated. The ROSA software was also used for the analysis of seven different membrane elements. The experimental data were utilized in order to validate the simulation results of the ROSA software. A variance-based sensitivity analysis was performed in order to define the most effective design and operating parameters. The present investigation shows that the tap and brackish water membrane elements are more sensitive to the feed water temperature rather than the feed water pressure and concentration. Meanwhile, seawater membrane elements are more affected by the feed concentration. The detailed investigation of the different membrane elements shows that wastewater reclamation using reverse osmosis technology could be a significant source of low-cost fresh water for hot climate countries.

TI Nonlinear FE model updating and reconstruction of the response of an

AB Nonlinear finite element (FE) modeling has been widely used to investigate the effects of seismic isolation on the response of bridges to earthquakes. However, most FE models of seismic isolated bridges (SIB) have used seismic isolator models calibrated from component test data, while the prediction accuracy of nonlinear FE models of SIB is rarely addressed by using data recorded from instrumented bridges. In this paper, the accuracy of a state-of-the-art FE model is studied through nonlinear FE model updating (FEMU) of an existing instrumented SIB, the Marga-Marga Bridge located in Vina del Mar, Chile. The seismic isolator models are updated in 2 phases: component-wise and system-wise FEMU. The isolator model parameters obtained from 23 isolator component tests show large scatter, and poor goodness of fit of the FE-predicted bridge response to the 2010 Mw 8.8 Maule, Chile Earthquake is obtained when most of those parameter sets are used for the isolator elements of the bridge model. In contrast, good agreement is obtained between the FE-predicted and measured bridge response when the isolator model parameters are calibrated using the bridge response data recorded during the mega-earthquake. Nonlinear FEMU is conducted by solving single- and multiobjective optimization problems using high-throughput cloud computing. The updated FE model is then used to reconstruct response quantities not recorded during the earthquake, gaining more insight into the effects of seismic isolation on the response of the bridge during the strong earthquake.

AB This paper describes the MetaCompose music generator, a compositional, extensible framework for affective music composition. In this context 'affective' refers to the music generator's ability to express emotional information. The main purpose of MetaCompose is to create music in real-time that can express different mood-states, which we achieve through a unique combination of a graph traversal-based chord sequence generator, a search-based melody generator, a pattern-based accompaniment generator, and a theory for mood expression. Melody generation uses a novel evolutionary technique combining FI-2POP with multi-objective optimization. This allows us to explore a Pareto front of diverse solutions that are creatively equivalent under the terms of a multi-criteria objective function. Two quantitative user studies were performed to evaluate the system: one focusing on the music generation technique, and the other that explores valence expression, via the introduction of dissonances. The results of these studies demonstrate (i) that each part of the generation system improves the perceived quality of the music produced, and (ii) how valence expression via dissonance produces the perceived affective state. This system, which can reliably generate affect-expressive music, can subsequently be integrated in any kind of interactive application (e.g., games) to create an adaptive and dynamic soundtrack.

AB Measurement and control of electric power quality (PQ) parameters in off-grid systems has played an important role in recent years. The purpose is to detect or forecast the presence of PQ parameter disturbances to be able to suppress or to avoid their negative effects on the power grid and appliances. This paper focuses on several PQ parameters in off-grid systems and it defines three evaluation criteria that are supposed to estimate the performance of a new forecasting model combining all the involved PQ parameters. These criteria are based on common statistical evaluations of computational models from the machine learning field of study. The studied PQ parameters are voltage, power frequency, total harmonic distortion, and flicker severity. The approach presented in this paper also applies a machine learning based model of random decision forest for PQ forecasting. The database applied in this task contains real off-grid data from long-term one-minute measurements. The hyperparameters of the model are optimized by multiobjective optimization toward the defined evaluation criteria.

AB This paper deals with the optimization for performance and cost of the low-power permanent magnet synchronous machines used in automotive applications with focus on particularities of high-volume mass production and the constraints that arise. The described optimization loop is used to compare different 12/8 and 12/10 designs of interior permanent magnet (IPM) type. After showing that the 12/10 IPM exhibits the best performance-cost ratio, results obtained at different stages in the process (i.e., sensitivity analysis and constrained single-/multiobjective optimizations), for both no-load and load case, are provided. Finally, different aspects for reducing the complexity of the multidomain optimization problem (e.g., 3-D effects, iron losses, and effects of tolerances on the motor characteristics) are addressed.

AB The paper proposes a multiobjective optimization procedure for five-phase induction machines based on the NSGA-II (nondominated sorting genetic algorithm). In the optimization procedure, two objective functions are used (efficiency and cost of conductor material) along with 14 design variables, producing a large number of viable solutions. The design variables describe geometrical constraints, electrical and magnetic loading, and the wave-shape of the airgap induction. The underlying analytical model of the machine includes the saturation of the iron parts and magnetic losses produced by higher space harmonic waves present in the airgap induction. The most relevant solutions regarding the objectives are validated through the finite element method, showing that the method proposed here is able to find practical solutions which represent a high efficiency, a reduced volume, or even a compromise between these objectives.

AB High-speed (HS) electrical machines provide high system efficiency, compact design, and low material consumption. Active magnetic bearings (AMBs) bring additional benefits to the HS system, such as elimination of the friction losses, reduced wear and maintenance, and a built-in monitoring system. HS drivetrains are usually designed for specific applications and require a high level of integration. This paper describes a design method of the HS electrical machine supported by AMBs, considering their mutual influence on the system performance. The optimization procedure, which takes into account both the electrical machine and bearing designs, is developed. The optimization is based on a multiobjective genetic algorithm. The selected optimization parameters include the AMB and machine dimensions. The optimization objectives cover the electrical machine performance and the rotordy-namics. The results of the proposed optimization algorithm are implemented in the constructed 350-kW, 15 000-r/min induction machine with a solid rotor supported by AMBs. The prototype tests verify the design and optimization results.

ID MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION
AB A switched reluctance motor (SRM) with 12/10 poles is investigated in this paper. Compared with the conventional SRMs with single mode, the machine is not only able to be worked as a six-phase motor but also could be used as a three-phase motor, which is thus named multimode SRM (MMSRM). The primary dimensions of the stator and rotor cores are calculated by considering it as a six-phase SRM with long magnetic paths, and the performances of three-phase mode with short magnetic paths are used to test the parameters. The arcs of stator and rotor pole are treated as the optimization objects to minimize torque ripple and copper loss per torque and maximize torque per ampere of the MMSRM. A function is selected to solve the multiobjective problem and the final values of arcs of stator and rotor pole are determined based on the results of finite-element method. The effects of arcs of stator and rotor pole on electromagnetic performances of MMSRM are discussed independently, and a prototype is manufactured to test the simulations. A good agreement between the simulated and measured results verifies the validity of the analytical method and results.

AB This paper presents a design optimization methodology of a hybrid-excited flux-switching machine (HEFSM) for aircraft dc power generation. Hybrid machines are favored in new aircraft embedded generation systems because of their high power density. Their flux control capability allows the use of the more reliable diode bridge rectifier and makes them suitable for wide-speed-range dc power generation. However, in order to respect aviation safety requirements, these machines must have a limited remanent voltage, and, therefore, an optimal design is needed. At first, the electromagnetic performances of the HEFSM are studied using a transient finite-element model. In order to perform design optimization, a static method is used instead. This method is shown to bemuch less time consuming and more suitable for optimization routines. The results have shown very promising performances of the new design. Despite having a very small remanent voltage, high power density has still been achieved.

AB The main aim of this paper is the imposition of constraints for the multiobjective optimizations of magnetic gears. In order to reduce the computational effort, a semianalytic design procedure is adopted, providing a fast simulation tool that can be embedded within an optimization loop. Magnetic, thermal, and mechanical constraints are discussed and embedded into a stochastic algorithm, in order to identify immediately infeasible geometries. The algorithm that has been developed provides a useful initial design tool that can be adopted to locate the optimal solutions in the search space. This paper also presents the multistage magnetic gear topology as the counterpart of the multistage mechanical gearboxes.

AB In this paper, we focus on necessary and sufficient efficiency conditions for optimization problems with multiple objectives and a feasible set defined by interval-valued functions. A new concept of Fritz-John and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-type points is introduced for this mathematical programming problem based on the gH-derivative concept. The innovation and importance of these concepts are presented from a practical and computational point of view. The problem is approached directly, without transforming it into a real-valued programming problem, thereby attaining theoretical results that are more powerful and computationally more efficient under weaker hypotheses. We also provide necessary conditions for efficiency, which have been inexistent in the relevant literature to date. The identification of necessary conditions is important for the development of future computational optimization techniques in an interval-valued environment. We introduce new generalized convexity notions for gH-differentiable interval-valued problems which are a generalization of previous concepts and we prove a sufficient efficiency condition based on these concepts. Finally, the efficiency conditions for deterministic programming problems are shown to be particular instances of the results proved in this paper. The theoretical developments are illustrated and justified through several numerical examples. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) is the simultaneous alignment among three or more biological sequences (nucleotides or amino acids). In recent years, important efforts have been assigned to the development of MSA approaches. In this work, we propose a framework that extracts the biological characteristics of an input set of unaligned sequences and uses this knowledge to decide which is the most suitable aligner and parameter configuration. We refer to it as Multiple Aligner Framework (MAF). The selection of the tuple [Aligner, Configuration) is based on searching, in a pre-computed file, the best tuple for a dataset with similar biological characteristics. In order to create this file, we use multiobjective optimization. In fact, three well-known multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (NSGA-II, IBEA and MOEA/D) have been used. To validate the framework, we have used five popular benchmark suites: BAliBASE 3.0, PREFAB 4.0, SABmark 1.65, OX-Bench and CDD 3.14. After comparing with well-known aligners published in the literature, such as Kalign2, MUSCLE, MAFFT, T-Coffee, MSAProbs, ProbCons, Clustal Omega and MUMMALS, we conclude that the multiple aligner framework is, in average, the method with the best balance between alignment accuracy/conservation and required runtime.

AB In this research, with regards to the considered geometrical parameters, a multi-objective optimization has been performed with the goal of achieving maximum heat transfer and minimum pressure loss in a swirl chamber. This objective has been accomplished by using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique, GMDH type Neural Network and the NSGA-II multi-objective optimization algorithm. The design variables include the ratio of inlet slot width to swirl chamber diameter, ratio of inlet slot height to swirl chamber diameter and the inlet slot angle. These variables are just related to geometrical parameters; and the Reynolds number, tangential jet temperature and the wall temperature are considered as constant. The objective functions include the averaged Nusselt number over swirl chamber wall and the pressure loss coefficient. CFD technique is used to analyze the flow and heat transfer and to compute the values of objective functions. The polynomials that relate the objective functions to input variables are obtained by means of GMDH algorithm. The obtained models are used to predict the values of objective functions as inputs for NSGA-II multi-objective optimization. Considering the range of changes of design variables, Pareto optimal points are obtained for the objective functions, and the Pareto points with special characteristics are introduced and discussed.

AB For speeding up query processing on Big Data, frequent sub-queries or views may be materialized such that the query processing cost is minimized with optimum cost of maintaining the materialized views and/or queries. Materializing frequent sub-queries and views means that resultant data set of the views reside in the memory of one or more nodes in the cluster, so that it reduces the MapReduce cost, submission and scheduling cost of Distributed File System jobs for query processing. We have defined materialized views as resultant data of frequent sub-queries and aggregation functions of a set of Big Data warehousing queries that are saved for enhancing query performance. The problem is defined as a multi-objective optimization problem for minimizing the total query processing MapReduce cost, MapReduce cost for maintaining the materialized views and the number of views selected for materializing with maximized total size of the views selected. We applied Differential Evolution algorithm and NSGA-II to study their performances for developing a recommendation system for selecting views for materializing in Big Data warehousing.

AB Human resources and potential secondary disasters are often neglected in the existing emergency resource allocation methods. This paper presents a multistage assignment model for rescue teams to dynamically respond to the disaster chain and develops three priority scheduling strategies defined under the burden-benefit accord principle. A designed NSGA-II, C-METRIC and fuzzy logic methods were developed to solve the above multi-objective integer nonlinear programming model. Finally, the experimental scenarios results indicated that the overall performance of the proposed method was satisfactory in comparison with current method regardless of whether the secondary disasters occurred sooner or later. It was demonstrated that the three proposed priority scheduling strategies outperformed the others; however, which of these three priority strategies is most appropriate for a specific disaster situation depends on the maximum rescue time allowed by the disaster.

AB The minimisation of both the mass and deflection of a beam in bending is addressed in the paper. To solve the minimisation problem, a multi-objective approach is adopted by imposing the Fritz John conditions for Pareto-optimality. Constraints on the maximum stress and elastic stability (buckling) of the structure are taken into account. Additional constraints are set on the beam cross section dimensions. Three different cross sections of the beam are analysed and compared, namely the hollow square, the I-shaped and the hollow rectangular cross sections. The analytical expressions of the Pareto-optimal sets are derived. As expected, the I-shaped beam exhibits the best compromise in structural performance, which is related on the particular loading considered.

AB This paper is devoted to the study of sensitivity analysis in terms of variational sets/asymptotic variational sets for parametric vector optimization. The relations between variational sets/asymptotic variational sets, and their proper minima of a set-valued map and that of its profile map are given. Then, the relationships between the above sets of this objective map and that of the proper perturbation map are established. Finally, the formulas for estimating the variational sets/the asymptotic variational sets of the proper perturbation map via the higher-order contingent set/the higher-order asymptotic cone of the constraint map and the higher-order Fr,chet derivative of the objective map are also obtained.

AB Electrochemical machining is a unique prevalent nonconventional manufacturing process used in different industries involving various process parameters, which greatly influence machining performance. Therefore, selection of proper and optimal parameters setting is a challenging issue. In this paper, differential evolution algorithm is applied to look for the optimum solution to this problem. Four parameters, i.e. voltage, tool feed rate, electrolyte flow rate, and electrolyte concentration; and two machining criteria, i.e. material removal rate and surface roughness (R-a) are considered as input variables and responses, respectively. The main purpose is to maximize material removal rate and minimize R-a to achieve better machining performance. In this way, comprehensive mathematical models have first been developed using response surface methodology through experimentation based on central composite design plan. Then, differential evolution algorithm has been utilized for optimizing the process parameters; both single- and multiobjective optimizations are considered, and optimal Pareto front is determined. Finally, optimization result of a trade-off design point in the Pareto front of R-a and material removal rate was also verified experimentally. This machined surface was examined with field-emission scanning electron microscope images. The results showed that the proposed approach is an effective and suitable strategy for optimization of the electrochemical machining process.

AB Buildings contribute to climate change by consuming a considerable amount of energy to provide thermal comfort for occupants. Cooling energy demands are expected to increase substantially in the world. On this basis, technologies and techniques providing high energy efficiency in buildings such as passive cooling are highly appreciated. Passive cooling by means of phase change materials (PCM) offers high potential to decrease the cooling energy demand and to improve the indoor comfort condition. However, in order to be appropriately characterized and implemented into the building envelope, the PCM use should be numerically analyzed. Whole-building energy simulation tools can enhance the capability of the engineers and designers to analyze the thermal behavior of PCM-enhanced buildings. In this paper, an extensive review has been made, with regard to whole-building energy simulation for passive cooling, addressing the possibilities of applying different PCM-enhanced components into the building envelope and also the feasibility of PCM passive cooling system under different climate conditions. The application of PCM has not always been as energy beneficial as expected, and actually its effectiveness is highly dependent on the climatic condition, on the PCM melting temperature and on the occupants behavior. Therefore, energy simulation of passive PCM systems is found to be a single-objective or multi-objective optimization problem which requires appropriate mathematical models for energy and comfort assessment which should be further investigated. Moreover, further research is required to analyze the influence of natural night ventilation on the cooling performance of PCM.

AB In modern era, the awareness of green energy technologies in the Microgrid (MG) is highly adopted in order to reduce the CO2 emission and for a clean environment. The distributed energy resources, such as solar photo voltaic (PV), solar combine heat and power (CHP), diesel engines, small wind turbines and fuel cell technologies are evolving within the power system. The control and maintenance of this power have great effect on power systems. For optimal use of electric power in MGs, the Multi-Agent System(MAS) technology is adopted and has certain applications in the power systems. This research article mainly focuses on MAS technologies used for the control of MG, its optimization and market distribution. A fully controlled architecture of MG using MAS with different optimization techniques applied to renewable energy sources has been deliberate. Moreover, comparison of centralized and decentralized approach of a MG is also discussed in this article.

AB Gradient-based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (G-NSGA-II) is successful for solving multi-objective optimization problems. However, the effectiveness of gradient-based hybrid operator is influenced by the distribution of individuals in the population. In order to solve the problem, based on the framework of G-NSGA-II, we propose an improved gradient-based NSGA-II algorithm by introducing a new chaotic map model named IG-NSGA-II. In this algorithm, a new hybrid chaotic map model is first established to initialize population for keeping the diversity of the initial population. Then, the substitution operation of chaotic population candidate is introduced to maintain the diversity and uniformity of the Pareto optimal solution set. Finally, the proposed algorithm is tested on several standard test problems and compared with other algorithms. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm leads to better performance results in terms of the convergence to Pareto front or the diversity of the obtained non-dominated solutions.

AB Our newly developed generation of procedural textures (GPT) system automatically generates procedural textures for the computer graphics industry. The system makes use of hybrid parallel Monte Carlo tree search and gender-based genetic algorithm modules that share a common multiple-generation population of procedural textures and a knowledge database. It also uses a multi-objective fitness function. The parallel Monte Carlo tree search module was inspired by gaming algorithms. To speed up the search, this module is enhanced with knowledge from previous successfully created procedural textures or tree node analyses. The gender-based genetic algorithm module automatically simulates several key features in natural selection and uses a multiple-generation breeding population, the notion of gender, and the concept of aging. This maintains diversity while providing many breeding opportunities for highly successful offspring. A third module selects generated shaders from the multiple-generation population and mutates them by replacing nodes with subtrees using the knowledge database. We evaluated the fitness quality of each module and compared the fitness quality of the system running in both single- and multiple-process mode. The optimal fitness quality was achieved by executing the system in multiple-process mode using a hybrid of these modules. We give examples of the GPT running in interactive mode, where a user directs the search towards the desired look using an esthetic evaluation.

AB The best way for an engineer or scientist to express their knowledge, experience and opinions is day-to-day verbal communication. When a decision needs to be made about an optimal groundwater control system, the decision-making criteria need not always be numerical values. If fuzzy logic is used in multi-criteria decision-making, the criteria are described by linguistic variables that can be represented through fuzzy membership and expert judgment is used to describe such a system. Prior hydrodynamic modeling of the aquifer regime defines the management scenarios for groundwater control and provides an indication of their effectiveness. In this paper, the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process is applied to deal with a trending decision problem such as the selection of the optimal groundwater management system. Linguistic variables are used to evaluate all the criteria and sub-criteria that influence the final decision and the numerical weights of each alternative are determined by mathematical calculations. The paper presents a part of the algorithm - fuzzy optimization in hydrodynamic analysis, which leads to the selection of the optimal groundwater control system. The proposed method is applied in a real case study of an open-cast mine.

AB The denaturation of whey protein samples that had previously undergone heat-treatment for different times at different temperatures and moisture contents was analysed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), using the DSC enthalpy as a measure of residual undenatured protein. Data were fitted to first order irreversible or reversible kinetic expressions, and the resulting rate constants were found to increase with both temperature and moisture content. The whole data set was then fitted as a function of time, temperature and moisture content, with rate constants varying according to either Arrhenius or Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) kinetics and with selected fit parameters made empirical functions of moisture content. The best fits were obtained using reversible WLF kinetics, which could be further slightly simplified without loss of accuracy. The model provides a platform for single-and multiobjective drying trajectory optimisation with respect to protein denaturation in dairy products. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, an analysis based upon thermo-ecology criteria has been performed for an irreversible solar-driven heat engine. In the conceived heat engine, heat is transferred by using simultaneous radiation and convection mode from the source at high temperature to the heat engine side and by using convection mode from the heat engine to the source at low temperature. The influences of the optimization variables on the thermo-ecologic performance have been observed by using the ecologic objective function and the ecological coefficient of performance (ECOP). Also various performance factors of the heat engine, such as thermal efficiency, power output, loss rate of availability and temperatures of the working fluid have been discussed in detail by considering the maximum ecological coefficient of performance, maximum ecological function and maximum power output conditions. The entropy generation rate at maximum ECOP is less than at maximum ecologic objective function conditions, while the power output at maximum ECOP is less than at maximum ecologic objective function conditions.

AB To improve the availability of limited spectral resources and construct a cost-efficient platform simultaneously performing both radar and communication functions, the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) integrated radar and communication system (IRCS), which is referred to as OFDM-IRCS, is provided. For the frequency sensitive target and frequency selective fading channel, it is able to improve the radar and communication performance by efficiently employing the limited transmit power in the OFDM-IRCS. To this end, we propose two optimal waveform design methods that meet different users' demands. First, the Cram6r-Rao bounds (CRBs) for estimating range, velocity and target scattering coefficients with integrated OFDM waveform are derived. And the channel capacity in communication is formulated. Then, the multiobjective optimization problem is devised, and the adaptive weighted-optimal and Pareto-optimal waveform design approaches are proposed to simultaneously improve the estimation accuracy of range and velocity in radar and the channel capacity in communication. Finally, several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multi-objective optimisation of capacity planning for a grid-connected Microgrid (MG) with multi-energy demands is developed in this study. The optimal multi-energy coordinated scheduling, in which uncertainties of renewable energy generation and electricity demand are described by uncertainty intervals, is considered within the capacity planning model. To solve the capacity planning problem while considering the optimal scheduling with uncertainties, a two-level optimisation approach is proposed by integrating interval mixed integer linear programming for scheduling into the multi-objective particle swarm optimisation for capacity planning. The multi-objective addresses the economic issue by minimising the worst-case optimal annual costs of device investments, operation and maintenance, and pollutant emission treatment, as well as the reliability concern by minimising the worst-case optimal annual costs of energy outage. Several MG cases studies are shown to demonstrate the proposed method.

AB Inspired by the idea of Artificial Immune System, many researches of wireless sensor network (WSN) intrusion detection is based on the artificial intelligent system (AIS). However, a large number of generated detectors, black hole, overlap problem of NSA have impeded further used in WSN. In order to improve the anomaly detection performance for WSN, detector generation mechanism need to be improved. Therefore, in this paper, a Differential Evolution Constraint Multi-objective Optimization Problem based Negative Selection Algorithm (DE-CMOP based NSA) is proposed to optimize the distribution and effectiveness of the detector. By combining the constraint handling and multi-objective optimization technique, the algorithm is able to generate the detector set with maximized coverage of non-self space and minimized overlap among detectors. By employing differential evolution, the algorithm can reduce the black hole effectively. The experiment results show that our proposed scheme provides improved NSA algorithm in-terms, the detectors generated by the DE-CMOP based NSA more uniform with less overlap and minimum black hole, thus effectively improves the intrusion detection performance. At the same time, the new algorithm reduces the number of detectors which reduces the complexity of detection phase. Thus, this makes it suitable for intrusion detection in WSN.

AB The Cu-Cl hydrogen production plants are one of the promising hydrogen production plants that have a higher conversion efficiency compared to water electrolyzing system. However, these plant requires a high-temperature source of thermal energy in the order of 530-560 degrees C. Such high-temperature source of thermal energy is aimed to be provided from the fourth-generation nuclear reactor. Due to a shortage in the technology of the fourth generation nuclear reactors in developing countries, one alternative to provide such high temperature of thermal energy is the exhaust gasses of gas-turbine stations. In this paper, a conceptual design for dual production cycle of power and hydrogen-based on the integration of gas cycles into the Cu-Cl thermochemical hydrogen plant was examined. The main product of the cycle was supposed to be 130,000 kg per day. However, the gas cycle is the upper cycle of the dual production plant; the electric power was considered as the byproduct of this plant. The aim was to present a conceptual design of the combined plant with the lowest cost of produced hydrogen and highest conversion efficiency, on the one hand, and the highest and cheapest cost of electric power, on the other hand. In this regard, the concept of pinch analysis and multi-objective optimization was conducted. Moreover, a decision-making tool was employed to find the best combination of gas turbines for the configuration of the upstream cycle. Different configurations of the upper gas cycle were examined by 39 types of commercial gas turbine. The final design of the combined plant could generate hydrogen with 51.3% thermal efficiency, 55.2% exergetic efficiency, and the cost of 4.02 $ kg(-1). This plant used four gas turbine's model Mitsubishi HI 501 F with 735 MW capacity of electric power generation at the cost of 0.10 $ kWh(-1). 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB In this paper, a novel two-archive Multi-Objective Grey Wolf Optimizer (2ArchMGWO) is proposed for solving Multi-Objective Optimal Reactive Power Dispatch (MORPD) problems. The optimizer has been improved from its original Multi-Objective Grey Wolf Optimizer (MGWO) by modifying the reproduction operator and adding the 2-archive concept to the algorithm. It is then implemented on solving MORPD with objective functions being active power loss minimization and voltage profile improvement (voltage deviation minimization). The generator bus voltages, tap setting transformers and shunt reactive power sources or flexible alternating current transmission systems are set as design variables. The proposed algorithm along with other existing multiobjective optimizers are applied to solve three test problems with the standard IEEE 30-bus, IEEE 57-bus, and the IEEE 118-bus power systems. The optimum results obtained from the various optimizers performance are compared based on the hypervolume indicator and they reveal that 2ArchMGWO is clearly superior to the others.

AB Substitution of petro-based aviation fuel with biomass-derived aviation fuel is an emerging strategy to reduce the carbon footprint associated with the aviation sector. There are several pathways for the production of aviation biofuel, and most of them require the use of hydrogen. Therefore, the analysis of the aviation biofuel supply chain must incorporate the production of hydrogen. This paper presents an optimization approach for the strategic planning of aviation fuel supply chains, which considers hydrogen production from fossil and renewable raw materials. The approach also considers extraction of fossil materials, growth of biomass, selection and several processing routes of the feedstock, along with the distribution of products. As a case study, the strategic planning of aviation biofuels in Mexico considering the generation of biomass and the hydrogen production is selected. The results show that significant decreases in producing costs and CO, emissions can be obtained if aviation fuel is generated from renewable raw materials. This finding is quite important, because in Mexico 90% of the consumed energy proceed from fossil sources. Several scenarios are addressed to assess the key factors in the design of the supply chain, reconciling the economic and environmental objectives; and also an analysis for the integration of the infrastructures of the fossil fuels and biorefineries is presented.

AB We consider a semi-supervised clustering problem where the locations of the data objects are subject to uncertainty. Each uncertainty set is assumed to be either a closed convex bounded polyhedron or a closed disk. The final clustering is expected to be in accordance with a given number of instance level constraints. The objective function considered minimizes the total of the sum of the violation costs of the unsatisfied instance level constraints and a weighted sum of squared maximum Euclidean distances between the locations of the data objects and the centroids of the clusters they are assigned to. Given a cluster, we first consider the problem of computing its centroid, namely the centroid computation problem under uncertainty (CCPU).. We show that the CCPU can be modeled as a second order cone programing problem and hence can be efficiently solved to optimality. As the CCPU is one of the key ingredients of the several algorithms considered in this paper, a subgradient algorithm is also adopted for its faster solution. We then propose a mixed-integer second order cone programing formulation for the considered clustering problem which is only able to solve small-size instances to optimality. For larger instances, approaches from the semi-supervised clustering literature are modified and compared in terms of computational time and quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we develop a decisional framework and a mathematical model for the sustainable design of biodiesel supply chain networks (BSCND). We consider a broad group of sustainable aims, i.e. standard economic goals (revenue and logistics costs of BSCND), environmental issues based on a biodiesel production life cycle assessment (LCA), and the social incidental aspects (e.g. crime control, political stability, and community attitude, among others). The framework begins with a simulation of the biodiesel production system, feeding later, with suitable input parameters and suitable solutions, and a macro location model designed to establish the regional positioning of biofuel conversion plants. Optimal regions are used as initial feasible solution space for the proposed micro-location model. In this part of the framework, we introduce an adaptation of Extended Goal Programming to rank the best municipalities (definitive locations) emphasizing the social aspects under consideration. The framework application is set up in the following Colombian context: first generation biodiesel production from palm oil feedstock. Our computational results indicate that the Colombian city of Rionegro (in the Santader region) is the most sustainable location for a new biodiesel plant. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article proposes a two-stage design optimization approach which is applied to a prototype passively designed high-rise residential building under different ventilation modes and thermal load requirements. Machine learning methods are employed to develop surrogate models for improving the computation efficiency of the multi-objective optimization process. The surrogate model is trained by modeling experiments with EnergyPlus and R, which can provide reliable energy performance indicators of generic building models featuring passive design parameters including the building layout, envelope thermophysics, building geometry and infiltration & air-tightness. The lighting, cooling and heating demands of the generic building model are determined by the hybrid ventilation and light diming control strategies in compliance with local green building assessment criteria in Hong Kong. The multiple linear regression (MLR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and support vector machines (SVM) are examined by the statistical modelling. SVM is capable of fitting a surrogate model with the best prediction performance based on the coefficient of determination and root mean square error. In addition, both single-sided ventilation and cross-ventilation models under varied thermal load requirements are investigated to compare the preferable design solutions for each scenario. The multi-stage optimization approach is also applied to a Mediterranean climate to explore optimal design solutions in more diverse external environmental conditions. This research can provide a highly efficient design optimization tool to appropriately deploy passive architectural strategies in a green building project.

AB The hydraulic variable valve actuation (HVVA) system can provide greater freedoms to the engine valve motions than most of the traditional cam-based valve train systems do. By considering the characteristics of the HVVA system, the strategies of putting its outstanding flexibilities into use for further improving the performances of gasoline engines with respect to power and fuel economy are developed in this research. A new GT-suite HVVA engine model is proposed which is able to realize the interdependencies of the HVVA system and the engine. In addition, the model is calibrated by experimental data and the proposed genetic algorithm (GA) optimization schemes are carried out for optimizing the engine outputs at full engine load and fuel economy at partial engine load. A potential average improvement of 10.4% on the engine outputs at full load over the entire operating speed range of the test engine is noticed from implementing the optimized HVVA valve motions. Moreover, the advanced GA algorithm for fuel economy optimization ensures the GA optimizer could maintain its proper functionality while non-linear constraints are taken into considerations. The late exhaust valve closure (LEVC) and early intake valve closure (EIVC) strategies are adopted at the same time for granting the engine an internal exhaust gas recirculation (IEGR) feature and together evolved into the HVVA strategy for fulfilling the partial engine loads without throttling. By conducting the advanced GA optimizations with the proposed HVVA strategy for partial engine load operations, the resulted break specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of the HVVA engine could be brought down by 13.1% on average with a maximum of 15.8% over its working speed range at the exemplary 7 Nm load point comparing to those of the original test engine.

AB The reliability assessment of a power system has become a significant subject in the power sector for both utilities and customers due to sudden increase in demand of a reliable power supply at minimal frequency and duration of power outages. This has prompted the utilities to use the accessible renewable energy resources (RERs) as measures to increase the reliability of a power system as well as reduction of over dependence on fossil fuels. The incorporation of renewable energy technologies into a radial distribution system has changed the single power source to bidirectional and multiple power sources. This improves the reliability of the system as well as reducing the power outages that associated with the radial distribution networks. In this work, wind turbine generator (WTG), photovoltaic (PV) and battery storage system (BSS) are utilized with the aim of improving the reliability of the existing microgrid power system and reducing the cost of energy (COE) and annualised cost of the system (ACS). The objective of the research work is accomplished by using the total outage cost (TOC), COE, ACS, annualized capital cost (ACC), annualized maintenance cost (AMC), annualized fuel cost (AFC), annualized emission cost (AEC), annualized replacement cost (ARC) and net present cost (NPC) of the power system. An fmincon optimization tool is utilized in this paper to investigate the effects of RERs in a microgrid system. The stochastic characteristics of the major components of RERs and their influences on the reliability of a power system are studied by using a Markov model. The proposed method is applied on the modified Roy Billinton Test System (RBTS) to establish the fact that RERs can be used to enhance the reliability and reduce the COE and ACS of the system. A comparative analysis of RERs is also carried out by studying the effects of interest rates on the COE, NPC and ACS of a power system. The results obtained from the research work demonstrate that the application of renewable energy distributed generation technologies has achieved better results.

AB Bioenergy sources have been introduced as a means to address challenges of conventional energy sources. The uncertainties of supply-side (upstream) externalities (e.g., collection and logistics) represent the key challenges in bioenergy supply chains and lead to reduce cross-cutting sustainability benefits. We propose a mixed biomass-based energy supply chain (consisting of mixed-mode bio-refineries and mixed-pathway transportation) and a multi-criteria decision making framework to address the upstream challenges. Our developed framework supports decisions influencing the economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Economic analysis employs a support vector machine technique, to predict the pattern of uncertainty parameters, and a stochastic optimization model, to incorporate uncertainties into the model. The stochastic model minimizes the total annual cost of the proposed mixed supply chain network by using a genetic algorithm. Environmental impact analysis employs life cycle assessment to evaluate the global warming potential of the cost-effective supply chain network. Our presented approach is capable of enhancing sustainability benefits of bioenergy industry infrastructure. A case study for the Pacific Northwest is used to demonstrate the application of the methodology and to verify the models. The results indicate that mixed supply chains can improve sustainability performance over traditional supply infrastructures by reducing costs (up to 24%) and environmental impacts (up to 5%).

AB Incentive-based regulations, toward higher performance networks, are the main driver for minimising losses in distribution systems. On the other hand, more renewable generation is needed to achieve environmental targets. Hence, a multiobjective model is introduced in this study seeking to minimise energy losses as well as maximise renewable generation in radial distribution systems (RDSs). Two alternative control strategies of future smart grids such as reactive power management using adaptive power factor control and coordinated voltage control are considered in the optimisation problem. The problem is subjected to the various technical constraints such as voltage limits, thermal limits and reactive capability limits of photovoltaic (PV) penetration, power factor regulations and underload tap changer adjustment. Also, the uncertainties of load and renewable generation are considered, too. Then, the obtained non-linear programming problem is relaxed and reformulated as a well-suited and computationally efficient second-order cone programming problems. To obtain more efficient and evenly distributed Pareto set to help decision-making process, a modified normal boundary intersection method is introduced for solution methodology. The implementation of the proposed framework on IEEE 33-bus RDSs shows the gains that the flexibility provided by innovative control strategies can have on energy loss reduction and PV capacity.

AB Alternative liquid fuels are attracting a lot of attention due to their potential for addressing possible future oil supply shortages. In China, oil shale, coal and biomass are considered as three significant feedstocks for alternative fuels. However, quantitative assessment of the sustainability of liquid fuels production based on these feedstocks is scarce. This paper uses the LCA (life cycle assessment) method to analyze energy consumption, GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions, cost and local employment effects of liquid fuels production from these feedstocks. The results show that the energy consumption of BTL (biomass-to-liquid) processes is much lower than that of production of petroleum based fuels, whereas STL (shale-to-liquid) and CTL (coal-to-liquid) processes have higher energy consumption; the GHG emissions of BTL are much lower than those of STL and CTL, which do not perform well from a GHG emissions perspective; when the crude oil price is lower than 50 $/bbl, there is no economic advantage from the three alternative fuels studied, however the economic benefits increase with increase in the crude oil price and become clear as the crude oil price approaches 100 $/bbl. It is further found that more local job opportunities could be created by developing these three alternatives. Several policy suggestions for sustainable development of the liquid fuels industry are formulated on the basis of four assessment metrics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is a promising method of generating power that utilizes low-enthalpy renewable energy and industrial waste heat. Given that the exergy loss and capital investment cost of heat exchangers account for a large proportion of the components in the ORC, research on the development of novel heat exchangers and configuration optimization coupling with other components and cycle parameters is essential to improve the ORC performance. In this study, an innovative liquid separation condenser (LSC) is incorporated into a waste heat-driven ORC system. A non-convex mixed integer non-linear programming model is formulated to simultaneously optimize the component configurations and system parameters of the LSC-based ORC. The objective is to minimize the electricity production cost of the ORC. The pressure drops of the heat exchangers are directly incorporated into the cycle model instead of ignoring them or constraining them by upper bounds. The physical property parameters of the working fluid are regressed using the Refprop 9.0 database to ensure the optimization of cycle operating variables. A case study is presented to test the proposed methodology and the formulated model. The results achieved using the simultaneous optimization method are compared with the results achieved using the sequential optimization method. The optimization results of the LSC-based ORC are also compared with those of the parallel flow condenser-based ORC. Then the influences of the key structure variables on the optimization results are studied. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of heat source parameters and environmental parameters on the optimization results are conducted. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work makes use of experimental design and response surface methodology to model Gas Metal Arc Welding processes. The correlations among three key geometric parameters, ie., penetration, bead width and overthickness, and four technological variables that define the welding process are quantified. Based on experimental data and using model selection techniques, a mathematical model has been deduced for each of the response variables herein presented. Using these models, a Multiobjective optimization is carried out to find the space of optimal solutions (i.e., the Pareto front). After a preliminary study of the relationships between independent and response variables, regression models are built. These models capture the data variability reasonably well (e.g., around 70% of the variability). These models are the basis to perform the multiobjective optimization using the epsilon-constraint approach. Results reveal that the conditions which favour a good balance between maximum penetration and minimum bead width and overthickness, involve a high value for gas flow rate, low values for electrode feed rate and voltage, and an intermediate value for the electrode position. This permits the authors to define the welding conditions that lead to an optimum joint geometry and then to guarantee its properties. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Simulation-based building retrofit analysis tools and electricity grid expansion planning tools are not readily compatible. Their integration is required for the combined study of building retrofit measures and electrified heating technologies using low-carbon electricity generation. The direct coupling of these modelling frameworks requires the explicit mathematical representation of Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs) in building-to-grid energy system models. The current paper introduces an automated calibration methodology which describes retrofitted buildings as parametric functions of ECMs. The buildings are represented using a lumped parameter modelling framework. A baseline model, representative of the building prior to retrofit, and the retrofit functions are calibrated using Particle Swarm Optimization. Synthetic temperature and heating load time-series data were generated using an EnergyPlus semi-detached house archetype model. The model is representative of this residential building category in Ireland. It is shown that the proposed methodology calibrates retrofitted building models to an acceptable level of accuracy (MAE below 0.5 degrees C). The methodologies introduced in the current paper are capable of generating lumped parameter building models with similar dynamics for different ECMs for any archetype building energy model. The identified building retrofit models have the potential to be integrated with electricity grid models in a computationally-efficient manner. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we consider a nonsmooth multiobjective semi-infinite programming problem with vanishing constraints (MOSIPVC). We introduce stationary conditions for the MOSIPVCs and establish the strong Karush-Kuhn-Tucker type sufficient optimality conditions for the MOSIPVC under generalized convexity assumptions.

AB Due to the stochastic nature of the nucleation event, producing the desired crystal size distribution (CSD) consistently is a challenging task in an unseeded crystallization process. A predictive dynamic model based on a population balance framework was developed for the unseeded batch cooling crystallization of L-asparagine monohydrate (LAM) from its aqueous solution. The nucleation and growth kinetic parameters were estimated simultaneously from the experimental data by combining the population balance model with a nonlinear parameter estimation technique. The model was then used to solve various optimization problems related to particle engineering. Both single objective and multi-objective optimization problems are solved to determine the optimal operating conditions for various objective functions reflecting the different desired attributes of the CSD. Finally, an attempt is made to achieve the desired target shape of the CSD by solving an appropriate dynamic optimization problem. The experimental implementation of the obtained optimal operating conditions clearly demonstrates the predictive ability of the developed model and the use of the optimization approach as a useful tool for particle engineering.

AB Hybrid Ad-hoc NETwork (HANET) is a fusion of both the static and dynamic topologies. Each node of this network consists of low capacity battery. Because of heterogeneous characteristic of the topology, network parameters are imprecise in nature. This, in effect, the performance and lifetime of the network degrade. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes an optimized energy efficient routing (OE2R) method. This method is inspired by artificial intelligence techniques such as multiobjective optimization, geometric programming, aspiration level, and tolerance limit. The fusion of such stated artificial intelligence techniques provide an effective tool to optimize multiple conflict objectives and estimate imprecise parameters of the network, simultaneously. The proposed technique OE2R is simulated using LINGO optimization software. To justify the effectiveness of the proposed technique, its performance is compared with some existing methods such as approximate linear programming technique for average cost bounds and linear programming-based efficient message delivery approach in hybrid network in several passes of performance metrics. The simulation results show that the proposed OE2R method performs much better with the comparative methods and may be implemented as energy-efficient routing for HANET.

AB A fault diagnosis and compensation problem for two-dimensional discrete time systems with time-varying state delays is studied in this paper. The concerned two-dimensional systems are described by the Fornasisi-Marchesini second model and are subject to unknown disturbances. First, a fault detection and diagnosis module is designed to obtain the information on sensor faults; a new fault detection and diagnosis integrated design, using the observer based on descriptor system approach, is proposed to detect and estimate the sensor faults. The integrated design can maximize the fault detection rate for a given false alarm rate. Sufficient conditions for the existence of the integrated fault detection and diagnosis design are derived in the context of norm evaluation and provided in terms of matrix inequalities. Second, a fault-tolerant control module is proposed upon an existing output feedback controller. When the sensor fault occurs, the faulty measurement can be identified and corrected by the proposed fault detection and diagnosis module. In this case, the feedback controller can guarantee the performance of the closed-loop system even when encountering sensor faults. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a thermal process to illustrate its effectiveness. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB With increased penetration of distributed energy resources and electric vehicles (EVs), different EV management strategies can be used for mitigating adverse effects and supporting the distribution grid. This study proposes a robust multiobjective methodology for determining the optimal day-ahead EV charging schedule while complying with unbalanced distribution grid constraints. The proposed methodology considers partially competing objectives of an EV aggregator and the respective distribution system operator, and applies a fuzzy-based mechanism for obtaining the best-compromise solution. The robust formulation effectively considers the errors in the electricity price forecast and its influence on the EV schedule. Moreover, the impact of EV reactive power support on objective values and technical parameters is analysed both when EVs are the only flexible resources and when linked with other demand response programmes. The method is tested on a real Danish unbalanced distribution grid with 35% EV penetration to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. It is shown that the proposed formulation guarantees an optimal EV cost as long as the price uncertainties are lower than the aggregator's conservativeness degree, and that EV reactive power improves local conditions without significantly affecting the EV cost.

AB Taking account of uncertain model parameters in simulation-based flowsheet optimization is crucial in order to quantify the reliability of the optimization results. Since chemical process design is a multicriteria optimization (MCO) task, methods to deal with uncertain Pareto boundaries are needed. The simplest of such methods consists of a sensitivity analysis of the Pareto boundary. In this work, it is shown how going beyond sensitivity analysis can yield favorable process designs not seen by sensitivity analysis alone. This is achieved by taking uncertainties into account by worst and best case Pareto boundaries or by considering the robustness of the Pareto boundary with respect to uncertain model parameters as additional objectives. In order to increase computational efficiency, for the first time, an adaptive scalarization approach is used to deal with uncertainties in MCO. The methods are illustrated by the calculation of a NQ curve of a distillation column.

AB Despite growing interest over recent years in applying reinforcement learning to multiobjective problems, there has been little research into the applicability and effectiveness of exploration strategies within the multiobjective context. This work considers several widely-used approaches to exploration from the single-objective reinforcement learning literature, and examines their incorporation into multiobjective Q-learning. In particular this paper proposes two novel approaches which extend the softmax operator to work with vector-valued rewards. The performance of these exploration strategies is evaluated across a set of benchmark environments. Issues arising from the multiobjective formulation of these benchmarks which impact on the performance of the exploration strategies are identified. It is shown that of the techniques considered, the combination of the novel softmax-epsilon exploration with optimistic initialisation provides the most effective trade-off between exploration and exploitation.

AB Due to the large temperature change of LNG regasification process (from about -160 degrees C to ambient temperature), the irreversible loss of the LNG regasification prnress is large, which affects the efficiency of power generation systems for LNG cold energy recovery. Our previous study proposed a two-stage condensation Rankine cycle, which can effectively improve the utilization efficiency of LNG. On this basis, this paper continues to discuss the effect of stage number of condensing process on the performance and economy of the power generation systems by LNG cold energy. Seven systems are considered in this paper, including three traditional power generation systems (direct expansion, organic rankine cycle and combined cycle) and four proposed systems (the two-stage and three-stage condensation Rankine cycles, as well as the two-stage and three-stage combined cycles). These seven systems are simulated by Aspen Hysys software, and with net power output, electricity production cost (EPC) and annual net income as the objective functions respectively, the key system parameters (the condensation temperature and the inlet pressure of LNG turbine, etc.) are optimized under the three different objective functions. Results showed that when the net power output is the objective function, the net power output of the three stage combined cycle is the largest. If EPC is chosen as the objective function, the cost of the combined cycle is always lower than that of the Rankine cycle system with the same condensation stage number, but net power output of the Rankine cycle is higher than that of the combined cycle. When annual net income is the objective function, the three-stage combined cycle has the largest annual net income. But if considering the difficult degree of control system, the two-stage combined cycle is recommended. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A method is presented to systematically analyze the decision space in the synthesis of energy supply systems. Commonly, synthesis problems are solved by mathematical optimization yielding a single optimal design. However, optimization is based on a model which never represents reality to perfection. Thus, the designer will be forced to revise parts of the optimal solution. We therefore support the design process by automatically identifying important features of good solutions. For this purpose, we analyze near-optimal solutions. To explore the decision space, we minimize and maximize both the number and the capacity of units while keeping the costs within a specified range. From this analysis, we derive insight into correlations between decisions. To support the decision maker, we represent the range of good design decisions and their correlations in the flowsheet of the energy system. The method is illustrated for the synthesis of an energy system in the pharmaceutical industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The "shale revolution" has been a game changer in the global energy market and raised the importance of optimal design and operations of shale gas energy systems. This article highlights key challenges and identifies potential research opportunities in the corresponding area. A brief introduction of shale gas energy systems and their significant impacts are first presented, followed by a comprehensive overview and classification of relevant publications. Based on the literature review, we further investigate and discuss the research challenges of developing integrated, sustainable shale gas energy systems under the guidance of "triple bottom line" and integrated approaches of material flow analysis and life cycle optimization. Leveraging the large amount of data from shale gas industry, data-driven optimization methods could open up new research opportunities for hedging against uncertainty in design and operations of shale gas energy systems. Moreover, potential opportunities are explored by introducing game theory into modeling and optimization of decentralized shale gas systems with multiple stakeholders. The benefits of enabling emerging technologies/operations are discussed as well. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Efficient water treatment design has progressively been growing in importance as the usage of water resources increases with population rise and industrial development. Their availability has been reduced with the more evident effects of climate change. Addressing this challenge necessitates more and efficient purification plants which can be realised by optimal design at conceptual stage. In this work, a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for the synthesis and optimisation of water treatment processes is proposed. Due to its numerous non-linearities and consequently, its non-stability, various linearisation, approximation and reformulation techniques have been implemented. Consequently, two improved formulations are derived, i.e. a partially linearised MINLP (plMINLP) and a mixed integer linear fractional programming (MILFP) models. The applicability of the mathematical formulations are investigated in case studies of seawater desalination and surface water treatment for the production of potable water. Finally, the models performance is analysed and compared against each other. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While standard life cycle assessment methods exclude fundamental process engineering models in its analysis, sustainable process design (SPD) is plagued by the dilemma of boundary selection that results in consideration of incomplete life cycles and shifting of emissions outside the system boundary. The Process to Planet (P2P) framework bridges this gap by combining sustainable process design with environmentally extended input output analysis. This framework extending across multiple scales provides the capability of working with process variables and designing processes at the equipment scale while considering the entire life cycle through the supply chain and economic scale models. This work expands the P2P framework to account for byproducts originating from any unit within the model. The framework is further modified to incorporate an economic objective function, henceforth developing a multiobjective (MO) optimization problem for optimal design of any generic industrial process. The modified P2P framework is demonstrated by application to a corn ethanol manufacturing process case study. The MO problem is solved using the epsilon constraint method to obtain Pareto optimal frontiers that reveal the trade-off between environmental and economic dimensions of the sustainable process design problem. Comparison between commonly practiced conventional SPD and P2P SPD Pareto curves exposes the chance of choosing non optimal solutions if the former method is employed.

AB While the problem of the optimal operation of gas networks has been the object of a large amount of research work, the inclusion of market mechanisms and environmental issues, leading to more complex models resulting in stochastic multiobjective optimization algorithms, has not been considered in its generality. The goal of this article is double: to identify the most general models and algorithms, capable of providing a complete decision support tool, and to show how simplified models can be obtained from them if the complexity of the network makes it necessary to reduce the computational burden.

AB Online social networks have a strong potential to be divided into a number of dense substructures, called communities. In such heterogeneous networks, the communities refer not only to dense parts of links but also to clusters present among other dimensions such as users' profiles, comments, and information flows. To find communities in these networks, researchers have developed a number of methods; however, to the best of the authors' knowledge, these methods are limited in taking only 2 dimensions into account, and they are also not able to give a sense of how users behave in their communities. To deal with these issues, this paper proposes a multiobjective optimization model in which a specific objective function has been used for each considered dimension in a given network. Because of the NP-hardness of the studied problem, an efficient and effective multiobjective metaheuristic algorithm has been developed. By juxtaposing the nondominated solutions obtained, the proposed algorithm can demonstrate how users behave in their communities. To illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, a set of experiments with a comprehensive evaluation method is provided. The results show the superiority and the stability of the proposed algorithm.

AB Electrochemical machining (ECM) is a nontraditional process used for the machining of hard materials and metal-matrix composites. Composites are used in several applications such as aerospace, automobile industries, and medical field. The determination of optimal process parameters is difficult in the ECM process for obtaining maximum material removal rate (MRR) and good surface roughness (SR). In this paper, a multiple regression model is used to obtain the relationship between process parameters and output parameters. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one of the optimization techniques for solving the multiobjective problem; it is proposed to optimize the ECM process parameters. Current (C), voltage (V), electrolyte concentration (E), and feed rate (F) are considered as process parameters, and MRR and SR are the output parameters used in the proposedwork. The developed multiple regression is statistically analyzed by regression plot and analysis of variance. The optimized value of MRR and SR obtained in PSO is 0.0116 g/min and 2.0106 mu m, respectively. Furthermore, PSO is compared with the genetic algorithm. The PSO technique outperforms the genetic algorithm in computation time and statistical analysis. The obtained values are validated to test the significance of the model, and it is noticed that the error value for MRR and SR is within 0.15%.

AB The choice of primaries for a color display involves tradeoffs among different desirable attributes, such as a large color gamut, high spectral reproduction accuracy, minimal observer metamerism, and low power consumption. Optimization of individual attributes often drives primary choices in different directions. For example, expansion of color gamut favors narrow spectral bandwidth saturated primaries, and minimization of observer metamerism typically favors broadband primaries. We propose a multiobjective optimization framework to characterize the tradeoffs among the different attributes for three-primary and multiprimary displays. Instead of a single design, the framework determines the complete range of available primary choices that optimally negotiate the tradeoffs among the metrics for the different attributes. Using results obtained in our proposed framework, we explore the impact of the number of primaries, the relation between alternative design objectives, and the underlying primary spectral characteristics. For primary design and primary selection, the proposed strategy is more informative and comprehensive than alternative single objective optimization approaches. Furthermore, within the proposed framework, we also consider alternative strategies for selection of control values for multiprimary displays and demonstrate that we can better leverage the advantages of multiprimary displays by selecting the control strategy to align with desired objectives. Specifically, observer metamerism is significantly reduced if control values are selected to explicitly optimize multiobserver tristimulus accuracy. (C) 2017 SPIE and IS&T

AB A Dual Command (DC) cycle "dynamic sequencing" method in unit-load multiple-rack AS/RS system under Time-Of-Use (TOU) electricity tariffs is applied in this paper. To make a type of energy-efficient model, overconsumption cost of on-peak period electricity, penalty cost of overconsumption of power, bounds on the total consumed energy, and accessible times of all facilities are considered in the model. Moreover, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is developed to achieve a near-optimum solution to the suggested energy-based mathematical model with the objective of minimizing the total cost of the AS/RS system under TOU tariffs. Considering that no benchmark is obtainable in the literature, a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm is developed to certify the outcome gained. For supplementary confirmation, we compare the total cost of our model with that of single-tariff model and also conduct sensitivity analysis of the allowable amount of power consumption. The system throughput, in terms of time and cost, is calculated for the model too. In the last part, sixteen numerical examples with different numbers of required storage/retrieval orders are suggested to display the function of the proposed procedure. Our outcomes verified that GA is able to obtain favorable and closer optimal solutions and the TOU tariffs model get the minimum total cost. (c) 2017 Sharif University of Technology.

AB This study presents a new multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), the elitist multiobjective tabu search (EMOTS), and incorporates it with MODFLOW/MT3DMS to develop a groundwater simulation-optimization (SO) framework based on modular design for optimal design of groundwater remediation systems using pump-and-treat (PAT) technique. The most notable improvement of EMOTS over the original multiple objective tabu search (MOTS) lies in the elitist strategy, selection strategy, and neighborhood move rule. The elitist strategy is to maintain all nondominated solutions within later search process for better converging to the true Pareto front. The elitism-based selection operator is modified to choose two most remote solutions from current candidate list as seed solutions to increase the diversity of searching space. Moreover, neighborhood solutions are uniformly generated using the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) in the bounded neighborhood space around each seed solution. To demonstrate the performance of the EMOTS, we consider a synthetic groundwater remediation example. Problem formulations consist of two objective functions with continuous decision variables of pumping rates while meeting water quality requirements. Especially, sensitivity analysis is evaluated through the synthetic case for determination of optimal combination of the heuristic parameters. Furthermore, the EMOTS is successfully applied to evaluate remediation options at the field site of the Massachusetts Military Reservation (MMR) in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. With both the hypothetical and the large-scale field remediation sites, the EMOTS-based SO framework is demonstrated to outperform the original MOTS in achieving the performance metrics of optimality and diversity of nondominated frontiers with desirable stability and robustness.

AB A novel comprehensive approach to solve a distribution systems' planning problem and to determine the optimal size, location, and technology of the distributed generation (DG) units with respect to the reliability of the system is presented in this paper. The objective functions of this optimization problem are power losses, DGs installation and operation costs, the DG owner's and the Distribution Company's profits as economic objectives. In the proposed method, new indices are defined to evaluate the reliability of the system. These indices calculate energy not supplied and volt ampere reactive not supplied due to active and reactive power shortages. Also, the average interruption frequency (AIF) and average interruption duration (AID) have been considered be minimized during optimization problem. The last two (AIF and AID) are modeled by the adequacy transition rate of DGs among states and are combined as a new objective function. To handle several objective functions, an adaptive fuzzy interactive multi-objective optimization method is used. The results on the IEEE 34-bus and 69-bus power distribution system showed the efficiency of proposed indices for reliability assessment of distribution system planning. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB In this article, a bi-level transportation network design problem with environmental considerations is investigated. To explicitly reflect various requirements of environmental sustainability from planners, total emissions costs and total excessive noise cost are minimized along with total system travel time while performing optimal capacity expansion. To leave space for additional information on decision making for planners and provide a more generalized description of solution optimality, the Pareto optimization approach is adopted. The study proposes a multiobjective variant of a new metaheuristic named Chemical Reaction Optimization as the optimization tool to solve the formulated network design problem. Pareto front approximations have been successfully acquired for each scenario tested using the Sioux Falls network. The results show that the relations between pairwise objectives can change significantly (e.g., from conflicting to aligned) with regard to different demand situations. The newly proposed multiobjective metaheuristic succeeds to produce better approximations of the Pareto front than NSGA-II with comparable runtime for the considered road network.

AB Transportation has a significant portion in greenhouse gas emission. Efficient transportation scheduling can decrease transportation costs and environmental damages by reducing fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emission. These advantages have made green transportation scheduling more attractive. This paper addresses the problem of integrated green truck transportation scheduling and driver assignment. We propose a bi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model to minimize total transportation-related costs (TTC) and total carbon emission (TCE). We consider TTC and TCE as manufacturer measure and environmental sustainability measure respectively. There is a contradiction between two objectives. We consider the ability of speed control for trucks to create the trade-off between TTC and TCE. A linearization technique is utilized to reduce the complexity of the proposed model. The Augmented a-constraint method is used to solve the model. Also, we develop a constructive heuristic (CH) approach to get high-quality solutions in an efficient CPU time. Some scenarios are applied to evaluate the model and heuristic approach. The results show the model achieves high-quality solutions in reasonable time. Also, the model and heuristic have a better performance compared to scenarios. Statistical tests are done to approve the comparisons.

AB We propose a simple heuristic method for the strategic Supply Chain Network Design (SCND) problem of a Brazilian tire company with four layers, multi-product in a single-period. Although several solution methods have been developed to solve this problem, mainly based on heuristic techniques, they have serious limitations in the number of warehouses, products, and consumer zones they can handle. This issue restrains their practical applications to the specific addressed real-world problem, involving hundreds of elements in these dimensions. The heuristic approach, combining a multi-start mechanism and a rounding strategy, is specially developed to solve large-scale problems in reasonable time. The rounding strategy solves the models proposed by the multi-start mechanism. This integration allows the required diversification in the solution search, avoiding stagnation in a local optimum. The heuristic method is first evaluated using randomly generated instances, with different sizes in terms of the number of suppliers, factories, warehouses, products, and customer zones. The obtained results show the solution method is competitive, compared with previous developed approaches, with the advantage of solving larger instances efficiently and effectively. The heuristic is then applied to the company, aiming to restructure its supply chain due to the overture of a new factory.

AB We first establish a new alternative theorem for a robust linear inequality system, where the dual statement is expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities and thus, it can be verified by solving a semidefinite linear program. We then apply the established alternative theorem to derive a characterization of optimality for weakly Pareto solutions of a robust linear multiobjective optimization problem, and to examine weak, strong and converse duality relations in robust linear multiobjective optimization.

TI On the trade-off between energy saving and number of switchings in green
   cellular networks
SO TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES
LA English
DT Article

AB Cellular networks are optimized by targeting multiple objectives. Usually, the different objectives are not coherent: minimizing the transmit power; the number of base station (BS) sleep-mode switchings, ie, ACTIVE/SLEEP state transitions; and the activity of the BSs and guaranteeing the quality-of-service (QoS) of users. Hence, suitable trade-offs have to be managed by network planners to provide an efficient solution to the challenge of booming mobile data. In this paper, we propose a multiobjective optimization framework aimed at minimizing the power consumption and the number of BS sleep-mode switchings in cellular networks, by jointly considering QoS requirements. These requirements are expressed in terms of a required bit rate for each mobile terminal. The framework deals with network management, such as the number of BSs that should be switched on, considering common diurnal patterns of the traffic demand. The optimization technique proposed in this paper is mixed-integer quadratic programming, which solves the joint power allocation and user association problem while also considering optimized bandwidth allocation schemes. The trade-off between the conflicting objectives, as well as the performance analysis in terms of the throughput and energy consumption of the network, is shown for different traffic load cases. The proposed optimization can obtain up to 60% energy savings during off-peak hours, guaranteeing QoS target requirements. By optimizing the network configuration, a 70% reduction in BS switch on/off operations can be reached in a day with 3% more energy expense.

AB Intermittent supply is a common way of delivering water in many developing countries. Limitations on water and economic resources, in addition to poor management and population growth, limit the possibilities of delivering water 24 h a day. Intermittent water supply networks are usually designed and managed in an empirical manner, or using tools and criteria devised for continuous supply systems, and this approach can produce supply inequity. In this paper, an approach based on the hydraulic capacity concept, which uses soft computing tools of graph theory and cluster analysis, is developed to define sectors, also called district metered areas (DMAs), to produce an equitable water supply. Moreover, this approach helps determine the supply time for each sector, which depends on each sector's hydraulic characteristics. This process also includes the opinions of water company experts, the individuals who are best acquainted with the intricacies of the network.

AB With the rapid growth of penetration of distributed generations and the strong interdependencies of multiple energy sources, the optimal operation of integrated energy systems (IESs) is becoming more important than ever before. However, current optimal operation strategies for IESs may be impractical because their potential negative impacts on utility grids are generally not considered. Therefore, in this study, an original multiobjective optimization model for IES operation is formulated to minimize the operational cost, primary energy consumption, and carbon dioxide emission of IESs and to optimally reduce the power loss and voltage magnitude deviation of the utility grid. Then, a novel Pareto optimization algorithm, called multiobjective strength firefly algorithm (MOSFA), is proposed to solve the multiobjective operation problem of IES. The strength firefly algorithm (SFA) uses a Boltzmann distribution and a chaotic-sequence-based population selection process to facilitate local exploitation and global exploration. In addition, a generalized piecewise normal boundary intersection (GPNBI) method is developed to transform the multiobjective operation problem into a series of highly constrained single-objective optimization sub-problems that can be effectively solved by the SFA. Finally, a hyper-plane-based decision making strategy is introduced to identify the best compromise solution for the obtained Pareto frontiers. The GPNBI-inspired MOSFA was comprehensively evaluated on a novel IES powered by natural gas, wind and photovoltaic generators. The standard IEEE 39-bus system is considered as the utility grid. The numerical results demonstrated that the proposed MOSFA exhibits competitive performance when compared to the algorithms of the state, which means that the optimized operation strategy provides a better trade-off between all objectives considered in this study.

AB Concerns over securing basic resources to an increasing world population have stressed the importance of critical interactions between the food, energy and water supply systems, as framed by the food-energy-water nexus concept. Current biorefineries producing first generation biofuels from food crops have impacted nexus resources, most notoriously land and food but also water and fossil energy resources required during cultivation and processing. Solutions to the nexus challenges of biorefineries require the search for alternative feedstocks and the application of methods that capture opportunities for synergistic interactions with the nexus. At the process level, more efficient water and energy use and food production could be possible if methods for extensive biomass fractionation, process integration and optimisation are developed. There is also a great opportunity to include the interactions between biomass supply and the nexus sectors in value chain optimisation to find strategic integrations that improve productivity and reduce losses and environmental impacts. By incorporating opportunities into a whole systems approach for design and planning, biorefineries will be able to balance nexus resource trade-offs, deliver their potential for full exploitation of biomass as the only source of renewable carbon and materials, and translate nexus issues into social welfare and sustainable development.

AB Optimisation of regional and local food-energy-water systems that takes into account the connections between the three sectors is classified into 'integration based on footprint' and 'integration based on co-decision'. Footprint-based approaches focus on the decision on one main system while using static footprint data to account for the links with other systems. By contrast, co-decision based approaches aim to simultaneously optimise multiple, interconnected systems. Choosing between these two approaches needs to consider the nature of the interactions between different systems as well as data availability and the feasibility of implementing the optimisation results. Future research in this area is expected to broaden decision targets and to improve the handing of the multiple scales involved in integrated food-energy-water decision making.

AB Finding the most appropriate configuration of building components at the design stage can reduce energy consumption in new buildings. This study aims to optimize the design of the envelope of a new residential building located in a warm climate (southern Italy). The thermal behaviour of the building has been analysed to evaluate the indoor operative air temperature for several configurations. The building prototype has been modelled using the dynamic simulation software TRNSYS 17 (A transient system simulation program, University of Wisconsin, Solar Energy Laboratory, USA, 2010) using a sequential search technique. Starting from the simplest building configuration, the main evaluated components are: walls, slab-on-ground floor, roof, shading, windows and internal heat loads. For each of these components, different design options have been modelled and compared in terms of indoor thermal comfort. Comfort parameters have also been taken into account to evaluate users' satisfaction with the optimized configurations. The study of the operative air temperature demonstrates that the absence of insulating layers in the ground floor ensures a lower internal temperature in summer. The paper shows how each component impacts the thermal behaviour of the whole building. It highlights the usefulness of the envelope design optimization that is characterized by high values of heat storage capacity, enabling internal temperature fluctuations to be kept under control, especially during summer.

AB The objective of this paper is to focus on the technical issues of single-stage thermo-electric coolers (TECs) and two-stage TECs and then apply new methods in optimizing the dimensions of TECs. In detail, some metaheuristics-simulated annealing (SA) and differential evolution (DE)-are applied to search the optimal design parameters of both types of TEC, which yielded cooling rates and coefficients of performance (COPs) individually and simultaneously. The optimization findings obtained by using SA and DE are validated by applying them in some defined test cases taking into consideration non-linear inequality and non-linear equality constraint conditions. The performance of SA and DE are verified after comparing the findings with the ones obtained applying the genetic algorithm (GA) and hybridization technique (HSAGA and HSADE). Mathematical modelling and parameter setting of TEC is combined with SA and DE to find better optimal findings. The work revealed that SA and DE can be applied successfully to solve single-objective and multi-objective TEC optimization problems. In terms of stability, reliability, robustness and computational efficiency, they provide better performance than GA. Multi-objective optimizations considering both objective functions are useful for the designer to find the suitable design parameters of TECs which balance the important roles of cooling rate and COP.

AB We present a building design optimization methodology that has been developed to address issues that researchers and engineers are currently facing when addressing the life cycle optimization of Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs). In order to reduce the required computational time, a Kriging model is used to surrogate NZEB performance criteria during the optimization process. The error estimation of the Kriging model is used for an adaptive sequential design to improve the Kriging model accuracy. A genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is considered efficient to find the global optimal solutions. We also propose a new algorithm to reduce the calculation time even further. The new individuals of the adaptive sequential design are filtered with satisfaction functions. It means that only the useful part of the Pareto front will be determined. Finally, we use network visualization for decision-making. We show that this approach is very powerful to help designers find one solution in the context of multi-objective optimization. Moreover, the partitions can give useful information about the characteristics of the optimal solutions.

AB Application of different types of nanoparticles including Al2O3, SiO2, and CuO is studied to find the effects of nanoparticles on the thermoeconomic optimization of a fin and tube heat exchanger. The effectiveness and the total annual cost are considered as objective functions, and optimization is performed using multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm by selection of nine design parameters including nanoparticle volumetric concentration and parameters related to the heat exchanger geometry. The effect of nanoparticles on total annual cost (TAC) vs effectiveness indicates that TAC increases by increase of effectiveness. The results also reveal that in all the studied cases, thermoeconomic improvement is found in the case of nanoparticle additive compared with the base fluid for the high heat exchanger effectiveness. Moreover, application of Al2O3 and CuO is more beneficial than SiO2 in the aspect of thermoeconomic point of view. Furthermore, Al2O3 causes a higher effectiveness in the case of considering nanoparticle price, while in the case of neglecting nanoparticle price, CuO is the best for the higher effectiveness.

AB Due to the heightened concerns of global environmental problems caused by the heavy use of fossil fuels, the sharp increase of energy use in the building sector has been recognized as an important environmental issue. One solution for efficient energy consumption in the building sector is building retrofits. This study proposes a two-stage integer programing model to select building retrofit materials and retrofit planning. The first model is based on a multi-objective optimization that derives an optimal retrofit strategy considering both energy savings and retrofit costs. Using the results of the first model, the second model finds an optimal retrofit plan to minimize losses for the building owner. Based on a real general hospital building in Korea, a simplified case building was used to verify the proposed models and for experimental analyses. According to the results of the second model, the building owner could adopt a building retrofit with less than 30-40% of the initial budget when compared to the total retrofit costs.

AB A kriging modeling method is proposed to conduct the temperature uncertainty analysis of an injection mechanism in squeeze casting. A mathematical model of temperature prediction with multi input and single output is employed to estimate the temperature spatiotemporal distributions of the injection mechanism. The kriging model applies different weights to the independent variables according to spatial location of sample points and their correlation, thus reducing the estimation variance. The predicted value of the kriging model is compared with the sample data at the corresponding position to investigate the influence of the temperature uncertainty of the injection mechanism on the injection process including friction. The results indicate that the significant error is observed at a few sample points in the early injection due to the impact of the uncertainty facts. The variance mean and standard deviation obtained by the model calibrated by experimental samples reduce largely in comparison to those obtained from the initial kriging model. This study indicates that model calibration produces more accurate prediction.

AB A multidisciplinary design methodology for a launch vehicle (LV) with a hybrid rocket was proposed in order to obtain qualitative design knowledge. In this study, a propulsion system performance and aerodynamic performance were empirically evaluated using a theoretical approach, and flight evaluation was performed by solving equations of motion to evaluate the motion along the horizontal/vertical directions and rotation around the body axis. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, two types of multiobjective design problems were solved using multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, and the results were visualized using the parallel coordinate plot, which is a data mining technique. The first design problem has two objective functions: the maximization of the highest altitude and the minimization of the total mass. In this case, the effect of the constraint related to the body length and diameter ratio was evaluated. The second design problem also had two objective functions and two constraints for a realistic LV design: the maximization of the downrange and the minimization of the total mass. The target altitude was different for these problems although the objective functions were identical. As a result, the trade-off information was successfully acquired for each design problem. It was also found that the body length and diameter ratio were key factors in deciding the maximum altitude. Furthermore, during the downrange maximization, the characteristic geometries observed in the obtained nondominated solutions revealed the design required to fulfill the constraint related to the target altitude.

AB The effects of climate change are increasingly considered in conjunction with changes in water demand and reservoir sedimentation in forecasts of water supply vulnerability. Here, the relative effects of these factors are evaluated for the Washington, DC metropolitan area water supply for the near (2010-2039), intermediate (2040-2069), and distant (2070-2099) future by repeated water resources model simulations. This system poses water management challenges because of long water-delivery travel times that increase uncertainty, multiple water jurisdictions that constrain potential decisions, and future scenarios that simultaneously increase demand and decrease water supply during the critical summer period. Adaptation strategies were developed for the system using a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. Optimized reservoir management policies were compared using six distinct objectives ranging from reservoir storage to environmental and recreational benefits. Simulations of future conditions show water stress increasing with time. Reservoir sedimentation is projected to more than double (114% increase) the severity of reservoir storage failures by 2040. Increases in water demand and climate change are projected to further stress the system, causing longer periods of low flow and a loss of recreational reservoir storage. The adoption of optimized rules mitigates some of these effects, most notably returning simulations of 2070-2099 climate to near historical levels. Modifying the balance between upstream and downstream reservoirs improved storage penalties by 20.7% and flowby penalties by 50%. Changing triggers for shifting load to off-line reservoirs improved flowby (8.3%) and environmental (4.1%) penalties slightly, whereas changing demand restriction triggers provided only moderate improvements, but with few adverse effects.

AB This paper considers the sectorization of a large water distribution network into district metered areas (DMAs) and simultaneously optimizes rehabilitation of the network with new pipes, control valves, and storage tanks. Because available water resources are much lower in the dry season, both the design and operational settings are optimized to satisfy water-demand, water-quality, and pressure constraints, as well as efficiency indices under stringent conditions. Because of the heterogeneity of the multiple decision variables and the complicated way they interact through the multiple objectives (some complimentary and some conflicting), it is not possible to fully automate the simultaneous sectorization, rehabilitation, and operational optimization. Therefore, a multistage approach is used where engineering judgment and network graph simplification and visualization tools are used to find a good feasible solution that serves as a first guess for further optimization of sectors and operational settings, to achieve feasible solutions with better cost of implementation, demand similarity among DMAs, and better pressure uniformity in operations. A multiobjective agent swarm optimization framework is used to iteratively change the sectors at the boundaries. For the final configuration, sequential linear programming is used to find optimal valve and pump settings. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB Reservoir operations are central to our ability to manage river basin systems serving conflicting multi-sectoral demands under increasingly uncertain futures. These challenges motivate the need for new solution strategies capable of effectively and efficiently discovering the multi-sectoral tradeoffs that are inherent to alternative reservoir operation policies. Evolutionary many-objective direct policy search (EMODPS) is gaining importance in this context due to its capability of addressing multiple objectives and its flexibility in incorporating multiple sources of uncertainties. This simulation-optimization framework has high potential for addressing the complexities of water resources management, and it can benefit from current advances in parallel computing and meta-heuristics. This study contributes a diagnostic assessment of state-of-the-art parallel strategies for the auto-adaptive Borg Multi Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) to support EMODPS. Our analysis focuses on the Lower Susquehanna River Basin (LSRB) system where multiple sectoral demands from hydropower production, urban water supply, recreation and environmental flows need to be balanced. Using EMODPS with different parallel configurations of the Borg MOEA, we optimize operating policies over different size ensembles of synthetic streamflows and evaporation rates. As we increase the ensemble size, we increase the statistical fidelity of our objective function evaluations at the cost of higher computational demands. This study demonstrates how to overcome the mathematical and computational barriers associated with capturing uncertainties in stochastic multiobjective reservoir control optimization, where parallel algorithmic search serves to reduce the wall-clock time in discovering high quality representations of key operational tradeoffs. Our results show that emerging self-adaptive parallelization schemes exploiting cooperative search populations are crucial. Such strategies provide a promising new set of tools for effectively balancing exploration, uncertainty, and computational demands when using EMODPS.

AB In this article we introduce a new multiobjective optimizer based on a recently proposed metaheuristic algorithm named Variable Mesh Optimization (VMO). Our proposal (multiobjective VMO, MOVMO) combines typical concepts from the multiobjective optimization arena such as Pareto dominance, density estimation and external archive storage. MOVMO also features a crossover operator between local and global optima as well as dynamic population replacement. We evaluated MOVMO using a suite of four well-known benchmark function families, and against seven state-of-the-art optimizers: NSGA-II, SPEA2, MOCell, AbYSS, SMPSO, MOEA/D and MOEA/D.DRA. The statistically validated results across the additive epsilon, spread and hypervolume quality indicators confirm that MOVMO is indeed a competitive and effective method for multiobjective optimization of numerical spaces.

AB To improve energy efficiency, extensive studies have focused on the cutting parameters optimization in the machining process. Actually, non-cutting activities (NCA) occur frequently during machining and this is a promising way to save energy through optimizing NCA without changing the cutting parameters. However, it is difficult for the existing methods to accurately determine and reduce the energy wastes (EW) in NCA. To fill this gap, a novel Therblig-embedded Value Stream Mapping (TVSM) method is proposed to improve the energy transparency and clearly show and reduce the EW in NCA. The Future State-Map (FSM) of TVSM can be built by minimizing non-cutting activities and Therbligs. By implementing the FSM, time and energy efficiencies can be improved without decreasing the machining quality, which is consistent with the goal of lean energy machining. The method is validated by a machining case study, the results show that the total energy is reduced by 7.65%, and the time efficiency of the value-added activities is improved by 8.12%, and the energy efficiency of value-added activities and Therbligs are raised by 4.95% and 1.58%, respectively. This approach can be applied to reduce the EW of NCA, to support designers to design high energy efficiency machining processes during process planning. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Unsupervised band selection methods usually assume specific optimization objectives, which may include band or spatial relationship. However, since one objective could only represent parts of hyperspectral characteristics, it is difficult to determine which objective is the most appropriate. In this letter, we propose a new multiobjective optimization-based band selection method, which is able to simultaneously optimize several objectives. The hyperspectral band selection is transformed into a combinational optimization problem, where each band is represented by a binary code. More importantly, to overcome the problem of unique solution selection in traditional multiobjective methods, we develop a new incorporated rank-based solution set concentration approach in the process of Tchebycheff decomposition. The performance of our method is evaluated under the application of hyperspectral imagery classification. Three recently proposed band selection methods are compared.

AB Barrier coverage with wireless sensors aims at detecting intruders who attempt to cross a specific area, where wireless sensors are distributed remotely at random. This paper considers limited-power sensors with adjustable ranges deployed along a linear domain to form a barrier to detect intruding incidents. We introduce three objectives to minimize: 1) total power consumption while satisfying full coverage; 2) the number of active sensors to improve the reliability; and 3) the active sensor nodes' maximum sensing range to maintain fairness. We refer to the problem as the tradeoff barrier coverage (TBC) problem. With the aim of obtaining a better tradeoff among the three objectives, we present a multiobjective optimization framework based on multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA)/D, which is called problem specific MOEA/D (PS-MOEA/D). Specifically, we define a 2-tuple encoding scheme and introduce a cover-shrink algorithm to produce feasible and relatively optimal solutions. Subsequently, we incorporate problem-specific knowledge into local search, which allows search procedures for neighboring subproblems collaborate each other. By considering the problem characteristics, we analyze the complexity and incorporate a strategy of computational resource allocation into our algorithm. We validate our approach by comparing with four competitors through several most-used metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that PS-MOEA/D is effective and outperforms the four competitors in all the cases, which indicates that our approach is promising in dealing with TBC.

AB In this paper, we consider a permutation flowshop scheduling problem with the total flow time as the schedule performance measure. A proactive-reactive approach is designed to simultaneously deal with stochastic disruptions (e.g., machine breakdowns) and dynamic events (e.g., newly arriving jobs and delay in job availability). In the proactive stage, the stochastic machine breakdown is hedged against the construction of a robust and stable baseline schedule. This schedule is either optimized by incorporating uncertainty into two surrogate measures or obtained by simulation. Robustness is measured by the expected schedule performance, while stability is measured by the aggregation of dissatisfactions of manager, shopfloor operator, and customers using the prospect theory. In the reactive stage, we assume that the stochastic and dynamic disruptions concurrently occur. Unlike the simple right-shifting method, a more effective rescheduling approach is proposed to balance the realized schedule performance with stability. A common issue in these two stages is the conflict between objectives. Thus, we propose a hybridization strategy that successfully enhances the classic Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II and the hybridized algorithm outperforms NSGA-II, multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition, and multiobjective memetic algorithms designed for deterministic scheduling problems. Finally, extensive computational studies on the Taillard flowshop benchmark instances are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed proactive-reactive approach and the algorithm hybridization strategy.

AB Design optimization of an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) is a complex and a computationally expensive exercise that requires the identification of optimal vehicle dimensions offering the best tradeoffs between the objectives, while satisfying the set of design constraints. Although hull form optimization of marine vessels has long been an active area of research, limited attempts in the past have focused on the design optimization of UUVs and there are even fewer reports on the use of high-fidelity analysis methods within the course of optimization. While it is understood that the high-fidelity analysis is more accurate, they also tend to be far more computationally expensive. Thus, it is important to identify when a high-fidelity analysis is required as opposed to a low-fidelity estimate. The work reported in this paper is an extension of the authors previous work of a design optimization framework, where the design problem was solved using a low-fidelity model based on empirical estimates of drag. In this paper, the framework is extended to deal with high-fidelity estimates derived through seamless integration of computer-aided design, meshing and computational fluid dynamics analysis tools i.e., computer aided 3-D interactive application, ICEM, and FLUENT. The effects of using low-fidelity and high-fidelity analyses are studied in depth using a small-scale (length nominally less than 400 mm) and light-weight (less than 450 g) toy submarine. Useful insights on possible means to identify appropriateness of fidelity models via correlation measures are proposed. The term optimality used in this paper refers to optimal hull form shapes that satisfy placement of a set of prescribed internal components.

AB Ensemble flood forecasts by hydrological models using numerical weather prediction products as forcing data are becoming more commonly used in operational flood forecasting applications. In this study, a hydrological ensemble flood forecasting system comprised of an automatically calibrated Variable Infiltration Capacity model and quantitative precipitation forecasts from TIGGE dataset is constructed for Lanjiang Basin, Southeast China. The impacts of calibration strategies and ensemble methods on the performance of the system are then evaluated. The hydrological model is optimized by the parallel programmed epsilon-NSGA II multi-objective algorithm. According to the solutions by epsilon-NSGA II, two differently parameterized models are determined to simulate daily flows and peak flows at each of the three hydrological stations. Then a simple yet effective modular approach is proposed to combine these daily and peak flows at the same station into one composite series. Five ensemble methods and various evaluation metrics are adopted. The results show that e-NSGA II can provide an objective determination on parameter estimation, and the parallel program permits a more efficient simulation. It is also demonstrated that the forecasts from ECMWF have more favorable skill scores than other Ensemble Prediction Systems. The multimodel ensembles have advantages over all the single model ensembles and the multimodel methods weighted on members and skill scores outperform other methods. Furthermore, the overall performance at three stations can be satisfactory up to ten days, however the hydrological errors can degrade the skill score by approximately 2 days, and the influence persists until a lead time of 10 days with a weakening trend. With respect to peak flows selected by the Peaks Over Threshold approach, the ensemble means from single models or multimodels are generally underestimated, indicating that the ensemble mean can bring overall improvement in forecasting of flows. For peak values taking flood forecasts from each individual member into account is more appropriate. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB State of energy (SOE) is an important index for the electrochemical energy storage system in electric vehicles. In this paper, a robust state of energy estimation method in combination with a physical model parameter identification method is proposed to achieve accurate battery state estimation at different operating conditions and different aging stages. A physics-based fractional order model with variable solid-state diffusivity (FOM-VSSD) is used to characterize the dynamic performance of a LiFePO4/graphite battery. In order to update the model parameter automatically at different aging stages, a multistep model parameter identification method based on the lexicographic optimization is especially designed for the electric vehicle operating conditions. As the battery available energy changes with different applied load current profiles, the relationship between the remaining energy loss and the state of charge, the average current as well as the average squared current is modeled. The SOE with different operating conditions and different aging stages are estimated based on an adaptive fractional order extended Kalman filter (AFEKF). Validation results show that the overall SOE estimation error is within +/- 5%. The proposed method is suitable for the electric vehicle online applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Distributed generation (DG) planning studies are generally conducted while assuming constant generation and load models. However, in this paper, optimal allocation of photovoltaic (PV) based DG is carried out while considering probabilistic generation and time varying voltage dependent load models. First, a novel probabilistic generation model is proposed for solar irradiance uncertainty modeling to compute the hourly output power produced via PV units. Subsequently, the obtained power values arc used to determine the optimum PV allocation in the distribution system through particle swarm optimization to minimize the multi-objective function. The proposed algorithm has been validated on 33-bus and 69-bus distribution test systems. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is suitable for solar irradiance modeling and can be employed in power system planning studies. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB In this paper, we tackle the aircraft conflict resolution problem under uncertainties. We consider errors due to the wind effect, the imprecision of aircraft speed prediction, and the delay in the execution of maneuvers. Using a geometrical approach, we derive an analytical expression for the minimum distance between aircraft, along with the corresponding probability of conflict. These expressions are incorporated into an existing deterministic model for conflict resolution. This model solves the problem as a maximum clique of minimum weight in a graph whose vertices represent possible maneuvers and where edges link conflict-free maneuvers of different aircraft. We then present a solution procedure focusing on two criteria, namely, fuel efficiency and the probability of reissuing maneuvers in the future: we iteratively generate Pareto front solutions to provide the controller with a set of possible solutions where she can choose the one corresponding the most to her preferences. Intensive Monte Carlo simulations validate the expressions derived for the minimum distance and the probability of conflict. Computational results highlight that up to 10 different solutions for instances involving up to 35 aircraft are generated within 3 minutes.

AB Construction of dams is a conventional way to deal with the problem of water scarcity in undeveloped basins. The economic and the environmental effects of dams are often evaluated locally rather than in a basin frame. The distinctive feature of this paper is to propose a basin-wide approach, comprised three steps for determining dams' locations and dams' capacities based on optimization modelling. Our approach provides an environmentally sound plan for surface water development that also results in the highest profit for the basin, for the sake of achieving sustainable development. The first step of our approach runs a mixed-integer linear model to give optimal locations and capacities of new dams for various number of dams along with satisfying the environmental water requirements in the entire basin. The second step uses a sensitivity analysis to finalize the number of dams in the basin by comparison of the basin profits, given by the various number of dams. Finally, the third step of the algorithm investigates the possibility of dams' capacities reduction, for the selected number of dams while they still provide the same basin profit, given from the first step, using another mixed-integer linear model. The introduced approach was applied to the Sefidrud Basin, Iran and its results showed that three dams could lead to an environmentally sound sustainable economic development for the Basin.

AB In this study, a multi-objective optimization of sustainable integration of algal biofuel production using nutrient recycling technology, such as anaerobic digestion and hydro thermal liquefaction, is considered. Gross annual profitability and global warming potential (GWP) are the criteria chosen for the design of the algal biofuel production system. Three scenarios, such as full-scale (baseline), pilot-scale (conservative), and lab scale (nominal), are chosen based on the expected maturity levels and nutrient demand. The results of the optimization produce Pareto sets of optimal solutions for acknowledging the trade-off between the economic and the environmental criteria of the integrated system. It is found that the anaerobic digestion (AD) technology shows better performance in terms of an environmental perspective, displacing the excessive fertilizer requirements due to its maturity in comparison with the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) process. However, HTL is a new, evolving, promising nutrient recycling technology which demonstrates economic preferences compared to the AD process due to its low cost of production.

AB This paper presents refined equivalent single layer plate theories develop by an effective N-objective optimization method, considering multiple displacements and stresses as output parameters. The refined plate theories reported belong to Best Theory Diagrams (BTDs), in which the minimum number of terms that have to be used to achieve a desired accuracy can be read. Maclaurin, high order zig-zag, trigonometric, exponential and hyperbolic terms are employed in order to investigate their influence on several static mechanical studies for sandwich plates. The used refined models are develop via the Unified Formulation developed by Carrera. The governing equations are derived from the Principle of Virtual Displacement (PVD), and Navier-type closed form solutions have been obtained in the case of simply supported plates subjected to bisinuisoidal transverse pressure. BTDs have been constructed using the Axiomatic/Asymptotic Method (AAM) and genetic algorithms (GA). The results are compared with the layer-wise solution in several benchmarks proposed in the literature. It is shown that the ESL plate models can accurately describe the displacement field and the mechanical stress fields predicted by a LW model with less computational effort, even for extreme theoretical cases. Furthermore, the method presented allows the user to analyze the influence of numerous test functions in a single run. The combined use of CUF, AAM and GA is a powerful tool to evaluate the accuracy of any structural theory. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB As an important component, the nozzle produces most of thrust in scramjets. A new concept of increasing the aerodynamics of the scramjet nozzle with energy addition is presented. The essence of the method is to create a heated region in the inner flow field of the scramjet nozzle. In this paper, the two-dimensional coupled implicit compressible Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Menter's shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model have been applied to numerically simulate the flow fields of the single expansion ramp nozzle (SERN) with and without energy addition. The variance analysis method coupled orthogonal experimental design has been introduced to investigate the effects of the energy addition parameters on the aerodynamics (i.e. thrust coefficient C-T, lift coefficient C-N and pitching moment coefficient C-M) of the scramjet nozzle. The numerical results show that the proposal of energy addition can be an effective method of increasing force characteristics of the scramjet nozzle, the thrust coefficient C-T, lift coefficient C-N and pitching moment coefficient C-M increase by 1.55%, 47.27% and 2.53% respectively. The effect of the energy addition density on the aerodynamics of the scramjet nozzle is substantial, and it must be foremost when considering the design of the scramjet nozzle. The findings suggest that scramjet nozzle design and performance can be benefitted from the application of energy addition. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Direct air capture of CO2 has the potential to help meet the ambitious environmental targets established by the Paris Agreement. This study assessed the techno-economic feasibility of a process for simultaneous power generation and CO2 removal from the air using solid sorbents. The process uses a solid-oxide fuel cell to convert the chemical energy of fuel to electricity and high-grade heat, the latter of which can be utilised to calcine a carbonate material that, in turn, can remove CO2 from the air. The proposed process was shown to operate with a net thermal efficiency of 43.7-47.7%(LHV) and to have the potential to remove 463.5-882.3 gCO(2)/kW(el)h, depending on the fresh material used in the calciner. Importantly, the estimated capital cost of the proposed process (1397.9-1740.5  pound/kW(el,gross)) was found to be lower than that for other low-carbon emission power generation systems using fossil fuels. The proposed process was also shown to achieve a levelised cost of electricity of 50  pound/MW(el)h, which is competitive with other low-carbon power generation technologies, for a carbon tax varying between 39.2 and 74.9  pound/tCO(2). Such figure associated with the levelised cost of CO2 capture from air is lower than for other direct air concepts.

AB This paper presents foresee'', a user-centric home energy management system that can help optimize how a home operates to concurrently meet users' needs, achieve energy efficiency and commensurate utility cost savings, and reliably deliver grid services based on utility signals. Foresee is built on a multiobjective model predictive control framework, wherein the objectives consist of energy cost, thermal comfort, user convenience, and carbon emission. Foresee learns user preferences on different objectives and acts on their behalf to operate building equipment, such as home appliances, photovoltaic systems, and battery storage. In this work, machine learning algorithms were used to derive data-driven appliance models and usage patterns to predict the home's future energy consumption. This approach enables highly accurate predictions of comfort needs, energy costs, environmental impacts, and grid service availability. Simulation studies were performed on field data from a residential building stock data set collected in the Pacific Northwest. Results indicated that foresee generated up to 7.6% whole-home energy savings without requiring substantial behavioral changes. When responding to demand response events, foresee was able to provide load forecasts upon receipt of event notifications and delivered the committed demand response services with 10% or fewer errors. Foresee fully utilized the potential of the battery storage and controllable building loads and delivered up to 7.0-kW load reduction and 13.5-kW load increase. These benefits are provided while maintaining the occupants' thermal comfort or convenience in using their appliances.

AB Credit rating is an assessment performed by lenders or financial institutions to determine a persons creditworthiness based on the proposed terms of the loan. Frequently, these institutions use rating models to obtain estimates for the probabilities of default for their clients (companies, organizations, government, and individuals) and to assess the risk of credit portfolios. Numerous statistical and data mining methods are used to develop such models. In this paper, the potential of a multicriteria decision-aiding approach is studied. As a first step, the proposed methodology models the problem as a multicriteria evaluation process with multiple and in some cases, conflicting dimensions, which are integrated to derive sound recommendation for DMs. The second step of the methodology involves building a multicriteria outranking model based on ELECTRE III method. An evolutionary algorithm is used to exploit the outranking model. The methodology is applied to a small-scale financial institution operating in the agricultural sector. We compare loan applications based on their attributes and the credit profile of the customer or credit applicant. Our methodology offers the flexibility of combining heterogeneous information together with the preferences of decision makers (DMs), generating both relative and fixed rules for selecting the best loan applications among new and existing customers, which is an improvement over traditional methods The results reveal that outranking models are well suited to credit rating, providing good ranking results and suitable understanding on the relative importance of the evaluation criteria.

AB Both active and reactive power play important roles in power system transmission and distribution networks. While active power does the useful work, reactive power supports the voltage that necessitates control from system reliability aspect as deviation of voltage from nominal range may lead to inadvertent operation and premature failure of system components. Reactive power flow must also be controlled in the system to maximize the amount of real power that can be transferred across the power transmitting media. This paper proposes an approach to simultaneously minimize the real power loss and the net reactive power flow in the system when reinforced with distributed generators (DGs) and shunt capacitors (SCs). With the suggested method, the system performance, reliability and loading capacitycan be increased by reduction of losses. A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) is adopted to select optimal sizes and locations of DGs and SCs in large scale distribution networks with objectives being minimizing system real and reactive power losses. MOEA/D is the process of decomposition of a multiobjective optimization problem into a number of scalar optimization subproblems and optimizing those concurrently. Case studies with standard IEEE 33-bus, 69-bus, 119-bus distribution networks and a practical 83-bus distribution network are performed. Output results of MOEA/D method are compared with similar past studies and notable improvement is observed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes a methodology for robust dynamic output-feedback control synthesis of uncertain linear systems represented by polytopic models. This control problem results in a semi-infinite optimization problem. The proposed synthesis procedure improves a previous two-step procedure, composed of synthesis and analysis, by employing both a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) and a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) strategy in the synthesis step. The analysis stage is performed via a Branch and Bound (B&B) algorithm, enabling the validation of the former step. In the proposed multiobjective approach, the project aim is to meet the specifications of (i) reference signal tracking response, (ii) disturbance rejection and (iii) measurement noise attenuation. The project specifications are quantified in terms of H-infinity and H-2 norms of closed-loop transfer functions. Essentially, this technique combines the flexibility of a dedicated MOEA together with the minimax semi-infinite programming problem. Since a MOEA evolves a set of candidate solutions in parallel, the suggested strategy provides a diverse set of controller designs, which is very useful for an a posteriori decision-making process. A proposed multicriteria decision-aid strategy is employed, in addition, as a controller design tool, aiming to incorporate the decision-maker preferences throughout the process, which (i) enables a guided evolutionary search to a trade-off region (of solutions) of practical interest and (ii) assists the definition of an adequate final controller, characterized by a reasonable practical trade-off concerning the criteria. The application of the suggested framework is illustrated on three case studies in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In many-objective optimization, the balance between convergence and diversity is hard to maintain, while the dominance resistant solutions (DRSs) could further harm the balance particularly in high-dimensional objective space. Thus, this paper proposes a novel selection strategy - boundary elimination selection based on binary search (called BESBS), trying to avoid the impact of DRSs during the optimization and achieve a good balance between the convergence and diversity simultaneously. During the environmental selection, the binary search (BS) is used to adaptively adjust the epsilon value in the epsilon-dominance relationship and assist in detecting the well-distributed neighbors for the elite solutions. Then the epsilon value obtained by BS is used for serving the boundary elimination selection (BES) to guarantee the stability of the elite population. To improve the convergence, BES is mainly designed to select individuals approximating to the ideal point. By modifying the fitness of solutions and choosing solutions in terms of the shuffled sequence of objective axis, the DRSs will be eliminated during the selection. Thus, BESBS could achieve a good balance between the convergence and diversity and avoid the impact from DRSs simultaneously. From a series of experiments with 35 instances, the experimental results have shown that BESBS is competitive against 8 state-of-art many-objective evolutionary algorithms. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Future development in cities needs to manage increasing populations, climate-related risks, and sustainable development objectives such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Planners therefore face a challenge of multidimensional, spatial optimization in order to balance potential tradeoffs and maximize synergies between risks and other objectives. To address this, a spatial optimization framework has been developed. This uses a spatially implemented genetic algorithm to generate a set of Pareto-optimal results that provide planners with the best set of trade-off spatial plans for six risk and sustainability objectives: (i) minimize heat risks, (ii) minimize flooding risks, (iii) minimize transport travel costs to minimize associated emissions, (iv) maximize brownfield development, (v) minimize urban sprawl, and (vi) prevent development of greenspace. The framework is applied to Greater London (U.K.) and shown to generate spatial development strategies that are optimal for specific objectives and differ significantly from the existing development strategies. In addition, the analysis reveals tradeoffs between different risks as well as between risk and sustainability objectives. While increases in heat or flood risk can be avoided, there are no strategies that do not increase at least one of these. Tradeoffs between risk and other sustainability objectives can be more severe, for example, minimizing heat risk is only possible if future development is allowed to sprawl significantly. The results highlight the importance of spatial structure in modulating risks and other sustainability objectives. However, not all planning objectives are suited to quantified optimization and so the results should form part of an evidence base to improve the delivery of risk and sustainability management in future urban development.

AB An optimization model for iron-making system covering sinter matching process to blast furnace process is established, in which the energy consumption, CO2 emission and cost minimizations are taken as optimization objectives. Some key constraints are considered according to practical production experience in the modelling. The combination of linear programming (LP) and nonlinear programming (NLP) methods is applied. The optimal sinter matching scheme under given conditions and the optimization results for different objectives are obtained. Effects of sinter grade and basicity on all the optimal objectives and coke ratio in blast furnace process are analyzed, respectively. The results obtained indicate that compared with the initial values, the energy consumption/CO2 emission of iron-making system decreases by 2.03% for objectives of energy consumption/CO2 emission minimizations and 1.89% for the objective of cost minimization, the cost decreases by 17.88% and 18.13%, respectively. All the three criteria decrease with the increasing lump usage, coal powder injection, blast temperature, and decreasing coke ratio for the iron-making system.

AB The optimum design for energy absorbers requires considering different criteria. Therefore, the design process can benefit from Multiple-Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) approach. Thin-walled structures can be particularly employed as energy absorbers in automobiles to dissipate energy and protect passengers from the peak crush load caused by severe collisions. The present study investigates a thin-walled conical segmented aluminum tube which consists of several circular sections with different thicknesses. To achieve the optimum design, a number of conical segmented tubes were modeled by finite element method. Energy absorption, initial peak load, crush force efficiency (the ratio of mean load to maximum load), mass of the structure and deformation type as the conflicting objective functions were defined as attributes/criteria. The numeric logic (NL) technique was applied to determine the weight of various criteria. Furthermore, the MULTIMOORA method, as a well-accepted MADM model, was utilized to obtain the optimum design for a conical segmented tube. The design variables included wall thickness, lengths of sections, and taper angle. Drawing a comparison between the top rank conical segmented tube and the top rank conical simple tube revealed that the conical segmented tube could increase the efficiency of the crush load up to 23.8% and reduce the initial peak load and mass of the tube up to 54% and 17.54%, respectively.

AB A general review of game-theory based evolutionary algorithms (EAs) is presented in this study. Nash equilibrium, Stackelberg game and Pareto optimality are considered, as game-theoretical basis of the evolutionary algorithm design, and also, as problems solved by evolutionary computation. Applications of game-theory based EAs in computational engineering are listed, with special emphasis in structural optimization and, particularly, in skeletal structures. Additionally, a set of three problems are solved: reconstruction inverse problem, fully stressed design problem and minimum constrained weight, for discrete sizing of frame skeletal structures. We compare panmictic EAs, Nash EAs using 4 different static domain decompositions, including also a new dynamic domain decomposition. Two frame structural test cases of 55 member size and 105 member size are evaluated with the linear stiffness matrix method. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of the Nash EAs approach, confirmed with statistical significance analysis of results, and enhanced with the dynamic domain decomposition.

AB Commercially available flow sheet simulators cannot perform optimization runs with more than one criterion. To overcome this problem, the flow sheet simulator CHEMCAD is combined with an external optimization solver, and the Excel VBA client is used to arrange inter-process communications. The resulting tool for multi-criteria optimization in chemical process engineering is applied to two separation problems. First, a dividing-wall column is used as a theoretical example to test different starting points and different scalarization techniques. Second, a significant decrease in energy demand is achieved for a real continuous world-scale facility.

AB In the present paper, integration of a two-stage absorption refrigeration system with a compression refrigeration system is proposed for utilizing low-temperature heat and reducing electric energy consumption. The proposed system is analyzed and compared with vapor compression system from the viewpoint of energy, exergy, environment and economics. The proposed system reduces the electricity consumption by 89.3% and CO2 emission from 112.6 to 12.1 ton/year. The size and cost of the system are determined by designing the heat exchangers. The optimization is also performed with the objective of minimizing the annual cost of plant operation which includes fuel exergy cost, initial investment and maintenance cost and environmental damage cost due to CO2 emission. The annual cost of its operation is 21.6% less than equivalent vapor compression refrigeration system which is further reduced by 18.2% through system optimization.

AB This study focuses on the optimal design of CCHP (combined cooling, heating and power) systems which were constructed at mix-buildings region. A natural gas-fueled turbine was proposed as prime mover for this application. The correlations between prime mover capacity and mixed ratio (residential building proportion of total buildings) is demonstrated in the design process. Our main task is to provide general guidelines for obtaining a feasible range of mixed ratio through various optimization objective, rather than emphasized on a fixed value in previous paper. Meanwhile the changes of feasible range of mixed ratio which varied with optimal prime mover capacity were analyzed seriously. Results show that: Residential buildings combined with hotels can obtain better flexibility than that combined with offices. For a larger energy consumption reduction and annual total costs saving, the capacity of gas turbine should be selected as small-scale. However, the feasible ranges of the mixed ratio is optimized showing a trend of decline as the capacity of gas turbine increase gradually. In addition, the application of CCHP system in mix buildings region results in better environmental performance than the energetic and economic ones, with 32.34% and 35.77% pollutant emissions reduction in two mix-buildings region.

AB In the design of low-energy buildings, mathematical optimisation has proven to be a powerful tool for minimising energy consumption. Simulation-based optimisation methods are widely employed due to the nonlinear thermal behaviour of buildings. However, finding high-quality solutions with reasonable computational cost remains a significant challenge in the building industry.
   In this paper, Ant Colony Optimisation for continuous domain (ACOR) is developed and applied to optimise a commercial building in Australia. The results for a typical commercial building showed that optimisation can achieve an additional energy savings of more than 11.4%, even after some common energy saving measures were implemented (e.g. double pane windows). The performance of ACOR was compared to three benchmark optimisation algorithms: Nelder-Mead (NM) algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimisation with Inertia Weight (PSOIW) and the hybrid Particle Swarm Optimisation and Hooke-Jeeves (P50-HJ). This comparison showed that ACOR was able to consistently find better solutions in less time than the benchmark algorithms. The findings demonstrate that ACOR can further facilitate the design of low-energy buildings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Thin-walled structures have been widely used in energy absorption and safety applications such as automotive, due to their lightweight and progressive folding modes. This work studies the collapse behavior and energy absorption of corrugated tapered tubes (CTT) under axial crushing numerically. The tested tubular structures were impacted axially with a striker's mass that is restricted to translational motion along the structures' axes. The effect of CTT's geometric features on different performance indicators, namely the initial peak force (PF), mean crushing force (MF), energy absorption (EA) and specific energy absorption (SEA) was studied. The results showed that the amplitude of corrugation is the most influential factor on the force-displacement characteristics of CTTs. Moreover, three deformation modes were found for CTT's, and the development of a mode was mainly influenced by the corrugation's amplitude and wavelength. In addition, for the tested range of geometric features, the initial peak force was found to be reduced when corrugation is adopted, especially for longer corrugation's amplitudes and wavelengths. On the other hand, the energy absorption (EA) and specific energy absorption (SEA) were found to be reduced when corrugation is adopted. Finally, it was found that the two most influential geometric factors on the performance indicators of CTT were the corrugation's amplitude and wall thickness. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, an optimization framework for complex environmental management problems involving multiple stakeholders is developed and illustrated. In the framework, problems are represented as a series of smaller, interconnected optimization problems, reflecting individual stakeholders' interests. The framework uses interactive visual analytics to explore and analyse optimization results, and the concept of Best Alternatives to a Negotiated Agreement (BATNAs) and an approach to reframe visualizations to encourage stakeholder negotiation. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, it is applied to a realistic case study involving multiple stakeholder groups funding different stormwater best management practices (BMPs) for a catchment management plan for a region of a large city in Australia. The problem features a total of sixteen objectives for four stakeholders. The results indicate that the proposed framework enables the identification of solutions that provide optimal trade-offs between many objectives and provides an effective and efficient means of assisting stakeholders with identifying acceptable solutions.

AB Thermo-Economic analysis was applied to four different arrangements of Organic Rankine Cycle, using dry organic fluid as working fluid. These cycles were designed to use the geothermal outlet of the Sabalan flash cycle as a heat source. Evaluations were made for the proposed systems to determine the effects of important operating parameters such as turbine inlet pressure, condenser temperature, pinch point temperature and mass flow rate of geofluid on energy and exergy efficiencies, as well as total production cost. Moreover, objective functions of this parametric study were to maximize energy and exergy efficiency levels and to minimize the total production cost. Optimal values of operating parameters were determined by EES optimization using the "variable metric" searching method and defining bounds for each variable as constraints. Among cycles, the maximum energy and exergy efficiency of 20.57% and 63.72% were calculated in the IHE-ORC. The obtained results from the cost optimization, revealed that the lowest energy production cost and the lowest total energy cost were calculated to be related to the R-ORC (25.1 $/GJ) and B-ORC (2.47 M$/year), respectively.
   The main aim of this study was to use of Fuzzy TOPSIS as Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique to rank cycles based on problem criteria of thermodynamic and economic performance. These criteria include: energy efficiency (N1), exergy efficiency (N2), net power output (N3), production cost (N4) and total cost rate (N5). The method of Interval Shannon's Entropy was used to determine weight values of the criteria automatically. Thus multi-criteria analysis showed that the IHE-ORC was the best system in Sabalan. Additionally, the Basic, Regenerative and Dual fluid ORC were ranked second, third and fourth respectively.

AB Air traffic flow management (ATFM) aims to facilitate the utilization of airspace and airport resources and is critical in air transportation systems. During the past decades, several challenging problems have arisen from this domain and attracted intensive studies. This paper addresses the problem of alleviating the airspace congestion and reducing the flight delays in ATFM simultaneously. We formulate this problem as a multi-objective air traffic network flow optimization (MATNFO) problem. In this MATNFO model, comprehensive ATFM actions, for instance, ground-holding, airborne-holding, rerouting, and speed control, are considered. Meanwhile, a systematic approach, namely route and time-slot assignment (RTA) algorithm, is developed to solve the MATNFO problem. The idea of divide-and-conquer is embedded in the algorithm by sequentially applying both route searching module and time refinement module. Furthermore, for the sake of efficiency, a pre-selection operator is proposed as one heuristic strategy to identify promising solutions and reduce the search space by defining a sector equilibrium metric. Experiments on real data of the Chinese airspace show that the RTA algorithm outperforms an existing competitor and three related multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. In addition, RTA is competent for high-quality real-time air traffic network flow assignment.

AB An alternative to traditional low-speed/high-torque drive systems, which are currently used in industry, could be the use of a permanent magnet synchronous motor directly coupled to the load and running at low speed, instead of the induction motor along with its mechanical transmission parts. The paperin this contextdeals with the analytical design procedure, optimization, and evaluation of such a motor (5kW/50rpm) and focuses on 2 topologies, ie, with inner and outer rotor. Finite element method designs of the permanent magnet machines are implemented as solutions of a complex optimization problem and several goals (multiobjectives) are considered (ie, machine weight minimization or efficiency maximization) with respect to relevant constraints. Three optimization methods are adopted and applied and a weighted cost function is proposed. The effectiveness of our problem design formulation approach and the use of these methods, in finding alternative and competitive permanent magnet synchronous motor designs, are also evaluated. The results reveal satisfactory design solutions and present acceptable performance. Moreover, by means of simulations, the application of several commercially available ferromagnetic materials for the motors' stator and rotor cores is performed. Last but not least, the effect of pole-arc per pole-pitch ratio along with the magnets length variation is also investigated.

AB A novel surrogate-based constrained multi-objective optimization algorithm for simulation-driven optimization is proposed. The evolutionary algorithms usually applied in antenna design optimization typically require a large number of objective function evaluations to converge. The efficient constrained multiobjective optimization algorithm described in this paper identifies Pareto-optimal solutions satisfying the required constraints using very few function evaluations. This leads to substantial savings in time and drastically reduces the time to market for expensive antenna design optimization problems. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on the design of an L1-band GPS antenna. The algorithm automatically optimizes the antenna geometry, parametrized by 5 design variables with performance constraints on three objectives. The results are compared with well-established multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithms.

AB In the present study, a novel solar driven combined power and ejector refrigeration system (CPER) of 50 kW power capacity composed of an ORC (organic Rankine cycle) and an ejector refrigeration system is investigated. Solar driven CPER system is composed of two main cycles: collector cycle and refrigeration cycle. The collector cycle is made of a U-tube ETC and circulation pump and the ejector refrigeration cycle consists of generator, turbine, ejector, heat exchanger, condenser, evaporator, expansion valve, and pump. Thermodynamic performance of the proposed CPER system is evaluated and a thermo-economic analysis is conducted using the SPECO (specific exergy costing) method. A parametric study showed the effects of condenser temperature, evaporator temperature, generator pressure, turbine back pressure and turbine extraction ratio. The genetic algorithm optimization analysis is conducted which shows 25.5% improvement in thermal energy, 21.27% in exergy efficiency, and 7.76% reduction in the total cost of the CPER system. The results reveal that the performance of the CPER system is considerably improved at higher temperatures of generator and evaporator. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved.

AB Evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms aim at finding an approximation of the Pareto set. For hard to solve problems with many conflicting objectives, the number of functions evaluations to represent the Pareto front can be large and time consuming. Parallel computing can reduce the wall-clock time of such algorithms. Previous studies tackled the parallelization of a particular evolutionary algorithm. In this research, we focus on improving one of the most time consuming procedures-the non-dominated sorting-, which is used in the state-of-the-art multi-objective genetic algorithms. Here, three parallel versions of the non-dominated sorting procedure are developed: (1) a multicore (based on Pthreads); (2) a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) (based on CUDA interface); and (3) a hybrid (based on Pthreads and CUDA). The user can select the most suitable option to efficiently compute the non-dominated sorting procedure depending on the available hardware. Results show that the use of GPU computing provides a substantial improvement in terms of performance. The hybrid approach has the best performance when a good load balance is established among cores and GPU.

AB Recent power system networks are characterized by large proportions, high interconnections, and high nonlinearities. Challenge of supplying the nation with high-quality, reliable electrical energy at a reasonable cost converted government policy into deregulation and restructuring environment. To achieve significant cost-savings, multiarea unit commitment strategies are employed, whose intention is to establish the optimal commitment stratagem for power generating units situated in numerous areas which are interconnected through tie-lines, and combined operation of generation resources can result in considerable operational cost-savings. Differential evolution is a population-based stochastic search algorithm, whose simple yet powerful and straightforward features make it gorgeous for optimization. Differential evolution uses somewhat greedy and less stochastic approach for optimization problem solution. Although global exploration ability of differential evolution (DE) algorithm is adequate, its local exploitation ability is feeble and convergence velocity is too low, and it suffers from the problem of untimely convergence for multimodal objective function, in which search process may be trapped in local optima and it loses its diversity. Also, it suffers from the stagnation problem, where the search process may infrequently stop proceeding toward the global optimum even though the population has not converged to a local optimum or any other point. To improve the exploitation ability and global performance of DE algorithm, a novel and hybrid version of differential evolution algorithm combined with random search algorithm is presented in the proposed research to solve multiobjective and multiarea unit commitment problem of electric power system. The performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm is tested with benchmark of three-area interconnected system, which consist of IEEE-30 Bus system. Experimental results show that proposed technique has the prospective for the solution of multiobjective and multiarea unit commitment problem and power generation scheduling in deregulated electricity market with import and export constraints.

AB This paper presents the optimal conditions for the ultraviolet laser percussion drilling of alumina materials intended for use in heat sinks. The Taguchi method and grey relational analysis, along with the consideration of multiple quality characteristics, were applied for determining the optimal parameters. The entrance diameter and taper angle of the drilled hole were affected by the material processing parameters, including laser power, pulse duration, focal plane position, and number of pulses. The Taguchi method and grey relational analysis were used for assessing the effects of the operational parameters on multiple performance characteristics. Nine experiments based on an orthogonal array were performed. According to the results, the optimal process parameters were as follows: laser energy density, 3.82 J/cm(2); focal plane position, 0.1 mm; number of pulses, 20 shots; and single pulse duration, 3 ms. Analysis of the grey relational grade revealed that the focal plane position was the most dominant parameter.

AB Evolutionary clustering is a popular method for community detection in dynamic networks by introducing the concept of temporal smoothness. Some evolutionary based clustering approaches need an input parameter to control the preference degree of snapshot and temporal cost. To break the limitation of parameter selection and increase accuracy of detecting communities, we propose a multiobjective discrete cuckoo search algorithm to discover communities in dynamic networks. Firstly, ordered neighbor list method is used to encode the location of nest for population initialization. Secondly, a discrete framework of cuckoo search algorithm is proposed with a modified nest location updating strategy and abandon operator. Finally, based on the proposed discrete framework, a multiobjective discrete cuckoo search algorithm is proposed by integrating the non-dominated sorting method and the crowding distance method. Experimental results on synthetic and real networks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective and has higher accuracy than other compared algorithms.

AB This paper presents a modeling as well as a numerical approach for geometric and material optimization of thin-walled functionally graded I-shaped cross-section beam focusing on lateral and flexural-torsional buckling problems. Material properties are assumed to be varied through the shell thickness by a non-monotonic function in which volume fractions of constituent phases have been estimated according to a piecewise cubic interpolation. Governing buckling equations, also a finite element method based on Vlasov's thin-walled theory are developed. Genetic algorithm (GA) is utilized as an optimal tool that preserving the computational efficiency of the overall analysis. N-point volume fraction through-the-thickness direction, as well as width-to-thickness, span-to-height ratios are simultaneously considered as design variables. The obtained critical buckling parameters are verified via several benchmark problems. Optimum results are found to be beneficial for a specific design of thin-walled functionally graded beams.

AB The optimal design of viscoelastic laminated composite panels with active piezoelectric patches is addressed in this paper. Constrained optimization is conducted to determine optimal distributions of piezoelectric patches on the top and bottom surfaces of laminated plates with viscoelastic layers. The design variables are the number and position of these patches, and the objectives are the minimization.of the number of patches, the maximization of the fundamental modal loss factor and the maximization of the fundamental natural frequency. The problem is solved using the Direct MultiSearch (DMS) solver for derivative-free MultiObjective Optimization (MOO). The objective functions are evaluated by a finite element model that was developed for laminated sandwich plates incorporating piezoelectric or viscoelastic layers. Trade-off Pareto optimal fronts and the respective optimal active patch configurations are obtained and the results are analyzed and discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Classical Markowitz mean-variance model is widely used for portfolio assets selection and allocation, which aims at simultaneously maximizing the expected return of the portfolio and minimizing portfolio variance. Many numerical approaches and metaheuristic algorithms have been proposed to effectively solve this portfolio optimization problem under an ideal condition. However, introducing various realistic constraints inadvertently leads to a non-convex search space, which has hindered the application of many classic, exact algorithms such as quadratic programming (QP). The increasing size of available assets and complex constraints has made the effectiveness of metaheuristic algorithms deteriorated. This paper proposes a hybrid bi-objective algorithm combining with the respective advantages of local search algorithm, evolutionary algorithm and QP with a pre-selection strategy. The algorithm first down select the assets that have greater contribution to the Pareto frontier by applying the pre-selection strategy. Then local search and evolutionary algorithm combined with QP are employed to fully exploit the useful assets combination modes to lead the search process toward the frontier direction quickly. The experimental study demonstrates that the proposed hybrid approach can obtain faster and better convergence compared with eight state-of the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. The results also show that the proposed method with the pre-selection strategy always displays a closer proximity to the Pareto frontier compared with k-means strategy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB An algorithm for solving the expectation formulation of stochastic nonsmooth multiobjective optimization problems is proposed. The proposed method is an extension of the classical stochastic gradient algorithm to multiobjective optimization using the properties of a common descent vector defined in the deterministic context. The mean square and the almost sure convergence of the algorithm are proven. The algorithm efficiency is illustrated and assessed on an academic example.

AB Biclustering has become a popular technique to analyse gene expression datasets and extract valuable information by clustering rows and columns of a dataset simultaneously. Using a good merit function together with a suitable local search can lead to the detection of interesting biclusters. In this paper, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with local search is proposed to search for multiple biclusters concurrently in a single run of the evolutionary algorithm. We call our method PBD-SPEA2 (Parallel Biclustering Detection using Strength Pareto front Evolutionary Algorithm 2). In our algorithm, a new dynamic encoding scheme is used to encode multiple biclusters in each individual. Our multi-objective function consists of three objectives that simultaneously optimizes the homogeneity of the elements in the bicluster, the size of the bicluster, and the variance of the column in the bicluster with respect to the entire dataset. Crossover is done by selecting and combining the best biclusters among the encoded biclusters from both parents through a strategy of exploration and exploitation. Finally, a sequential selection procedure is used to select the final set of biclusters from individuals that constitute the Pareto front. Experimental results are presented to compare the performance and biological enrichment of detected biclusters with several existing algorithms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper considers the downlink transmission of cloud-radio access networks (C-RANs) with limited fronthaul capacity. We formulate a joint design of remote radio head (RRH) selection, RRH-user association, and transmit beamforming for simultaneously optimizing the achievable sum rate and total power consumption, using the multiobjective optimization concept. Due to the nonconvexity of perfronthaul capacity constraints and introduced binary selection variables, the formulated problem lends itself to a mixed-integer nonconvex program, which is generally non-deterministic polynomial-time hard. Motivated by powerful computing capability of C-RAN and for benchmarking purposes, we propose a branch and reduce and bound-based algorithm to attain a globally optimal solution. For more practically appealing approaches, we then propose three iterative low-complexity algorithms. In the first method, we iteratively approximate the continuous nonconvex constraints by convex conic ones using successive convex approximation framework. More explicitly, the problem obtained at each iteration is a mixed-integer second-order cone program (MI-SOCP) for which dedicated solvers are available. In the second method, we first relax the binary variables to be continuous to arrive at a sequence of SOCPs and then perform a postprocessing procedure on the relaxed variables to search for a high-performance solution. In the third method, we solve the considered problem in view of sparsity-inducing regularization. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms converge rapidly and achieve near-optimal performance as well as outperform the known algorithms.

AB Thin-walled tubular structures are commonly used in automotive and aerospace applications because of their high strength and lightweight characteristics. In this paper we propose a new bionic bi-tubular thin-walled structure (BBTS) inspired from the internal structure of the lady beetle elytron. Six types of BBTSs with different geometric parameters and same type of material were simulated under axial dynamic impact loading with a weight of 500 kg and a velocity of 10 m/s using nonlinear finite elements. The comparison between BBTSs with equal mass shows that the thickness of the inner wall and the cross-sectional configurations influence significantly the energy absorption of the structure. BBTSs show an optimized crashworthiness behavior when the inner wall thickness is between 1.6 and 2.0 mm. In addition, circular and octangular BBTSs show improved absorption characteristics when the inner wall thickness is 2.0 mm. We also evaluate the energy absorption of periodically distributed BBTS against cellular configuration with irregular topology. The energy absorption characteristic of BBTS with regular distribution is better than that of BBTS with irregular distribution, which indicates that the optimized regular structure has an improved mechanical performance to the original bionic topology.

AB One of the most studied variant of portfolio optimization problems is with cardinality constraints that transform classical mean-variance model from a convex quadratic programming problem into a mixed integer quadratic programming problem which brings the problem to the class of NP-Complete problems. Therefore, the computational complexity is significantly increased since cardinality constraints have a direct influence on the portfolio size. In order to overcome arising computational difficulties, for solving this problem, researchers have focused on investigating efficient solution algorithms such as metaheuristic algorithms since exact techniques may be inadequate to find an optimal solution in a reasonable time and are computationally ineffective when applied to large-scale problems. In this paper, our purpose is to present an efficient solution approach based on an artificial bee colony algorithm with feasibility enforcement and infeasibility toleration procedures for solving cardinality constrained portfolio optimization problem. Computational results confirm the effectiveness of the solution methodology. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aims to present a comprehensive decision model for design of the integrated bioethanol supply chain (IBSC). In achieving this goal, we developed a new optimization model using mixed integer linear programming. The model consists of the objective function to minimize the required cost to establish the IBSC along with practical constraints including the limit of biomass, the capacity of technologies, and the land availability. This model is capable of identifying a wide range of solutions for the economically viable IBSC: biomass as a feedstock, technical configuration of the biorefinery, and supply chain solutions. We then analyze the impact of the policies to the bioethanol production and supply strategies by implementing the different scenarios of the bioethanol-gasoline blending policy. To illustrate the capability of the proposed model, we applied the model to the biomass-derived liquid fuel supply system of Jeju Island, Korea. As a result, the total supply cost was estimated to range from 0.83 to 0.88 $/liter according the blending policies. We also analyzed the preferable options to build the IBSC of Jeju Island: woody biomass to agricultural residues, gasification to fermentation as the main conversion technology, and regions with high biomass availability to high-demand regions.

AB In this Letter, the micro biogeography-inspired multi-objective optimisation (BiMO) method, an extension of the biogeography-inspired multi-objective optimisation (BiMO) algorithm, is proposed. It is suitable for solving multi-objective optimisations in the field of industrial design because it is based on a small number of islands (hence the name BiMO), i.e. few objective function calls are required. An analytical test function is used for evaluating the performances of the standard BiMO method and to show the need for the proposed BiMO algorithm. To test its performances in industrial applications, an optimal shape design problem in electromagnetics, i.e. an electromagnet optimal design, has been chosen as a case study. To the best knowledge of the author, the main element of novelty of the Letter is that the BiMO algorithm has been applied for the first time to a multi-objective design with a reduced number of islands (BiMO). The algorithm so modified leads to a strong reduction of computational time, and, at the same time, improves the quality of results.

AB Despite highest energy potential, solar energy is only available during diurnal period with varying intensity. Therefore, owing to solar intermittency, solar energy systems need to operate in standalone configuration for steady power supply which requires reliable and sustainable energy storage. Hydrogen production has proved to be the most reliable and sustainable energy storage option for medium and long term operation. However, at the first priority, solar energy must be captured with high efficiency, in order to reduce the overall size of the system and energy storage. Multi-junction solar cells (MJCs) provide highest energy efficiency among all of the photovoltaic technologies and the concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) system concept makes their use cost effective. However, literature is lacking the performance model and optimization strategy for standalone operation of the CPV-hydrogen system. In addition, there is no commercial tool available that can analyze CPV performance, utilizing multi-junction solar cell. This paper proposes the performance model for the CPV-hydrogen systems and the multi-objective optimization strategy for its standalone operation and techno-economic analysis, using micro genetic algorithm (micro-GA). The electrolytic hydrogen production with compression storage and fuel cell, is used as energy storage system. The CPV model is verified for the experimental data of InGaP/InGaAs/Ge triple junction solar cell. An optimal CPV system design is provided for uninterrupted power supply, even under seasonal weather variations. Such approach can be easily integrated with commercial tools and the presented performance data can be used for the design of individual components of the system.

AB The optimal design and planning of glycerol-based biorefinery supply chains is critical for the development and implementation of this concept in a sustainable manner. To achieve this, a decision-making framework is proposed in this work, to holistically optimize the design and planning of the glycerol-based biorefinery supply chains under uncertainties. This framework presents a multilayered strategy composed of different steps, and it is strongly based on optimization techniques, detailed economic and environmental assessment, and multiobjective optimization under a stochastic environment. To maximize the business value, the economic objective is measured by the Net Present Value (NPV), whereas the environmental performance is measured by the estimation of a Single Indicator (SI) through the application of LCA methods. As part of the framework, a stochastic multiperiod, multiproduct, and multiechelon mixed integer linear programming problem is proposed based upon a previous model, GlyThink. In the new formulation, market uncertainties are taken into account at the strategic planning level. The robustness of the supply chain structures is analyzed based on statistical data provided by the implementation of the Monte Carlo method, where a deterministic optimization problem is solved for each scenario. Furthermore, the solution of the stochastic multiobjective optimization model points to the Pareto set of trade-off solutions obtained when maximizing the NPV and minimizing environmental consequences. Therefore, the proposed framework ultimately leads to the identification of the optimal design and planning decisions for the development of environmentally conscious biorefinery supply chains. The effectiveness of the presented approach is demonstrated through its application to the realistic case study of the glycerol-based biorefinery in Europe, where the results showed that the optimal solution under market uncertainties is obtained by establishing a multiplant supply chain for the glycerol-based integrated biorefinery, built upon two plant site locations (Germany, France) based on the production of succinic acid and lactic acid.

AB Image reconstruction by 10 minimization is an NP-hard problem with high computational complexity and the results are sometimes not accurate enough due to the down-sampled measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel geometric structure based intelligent collaborative compressive sensing (G-ICCS) method for image reconstruction by to minimization. Firstly, the local geometric structures of image are exploited to establish the geometric structure based sparsity models based on the geometric over-completed dictionaries, which aims to enhance the reconstruction accuracy of image structures. To reduce the computational complexity and achieve the better reconstruction accuracy, we utilize the non local self-similarity property to obtain the geometric sparsity prior to guide the reconstruction for each geometric structure based sparsity model, respectively. Considering intelligent optimization algorithm has superior performance in solving combinatorial optimization problems and global searching and greedy algorithm performs well in reconstruction speed, we make a hybrid use of them to solve the 10 minimization essentially by designing the intelligent searching strategies. Finally, the image patches are estimated by the designed intelligent searching strategies under the guidance of the geometric sparsity prior to improve the reconstruction accuracy significantly especially when the measurement rate is relatively small. Some experiments test the proposed method G-ICCS on natural images, and the results demonstrate that G-ICCS outperforms its counterparts in both numerical measures and visual quality.

AB We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for robust efficiency (in the sense of Ehrgott et al., 2014) to multiobjective optimization problems that depend on uncertain parameters. These conditions state that a solution is robust efficient (under minimization) if it is optimal to a strongly increasing scalarizing function, and only if it is optimal to a strictly increasing scalarizing function. By counterexample, we show that the necessary condition cannot be strengthened to convex scalarizing functions, even for convex problems. We therefore define and characterize a subset of the robust efficient solutions for which an analogous necessary condition holds with respect to convex scalarizing functions. This result parallels the deterministic case where optimality to a convex and strictly increasing scalarizing function constitutes a necessary condition for efficiency. By a numerical example from the field of radiation therapy treatment plan optimization, we illustrate that the curvature of the scalarizing function influences the conservatism of an optimized solution in the uncertain case.

AB Italian energy policy has determined important keystones in building energy efficiency regulations and their application throughout the country. However, there is still much work to be done in order to make sustainable societies and territories, especially in historical contexts that have the greatest potentiality of energy saving. In detail, in the framework of conservation, restoration, refurbishment, and retrofit actions, the debate among scientists, administrators and skilled people is still open due to the many aspects yet to be considered and solved. In this paper, the state of the art of Italian residential building heritage has been reviewed, while energy retrofit issues and viable solutions have been investigated by collecting literature examples and experiences, focusing on common retrofit measures on historical buildings per thematic area. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of each action have been discussed.
   Anyway, two main aspects have to be solved yet: the high Payback Times and the restriction about Renewable Energy Sources installation on this kind of buildings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The public buildings sector represents one of the most intensive items of EU energy consumption; the application of retrofit solutions in existing buildings is a crucial way to reduce its impact. To facilitate the knowledge of the energy performance of existing non-residential buildings and the choice of the more adequate actions, Public Administrations (PA) should have the availability of proper tools. Within the Italian project "POI 2007-13", a database and a decision support tool, for easy use, even to a non-technical user, have been developed. A large set of data, obtained from the energy audits of 151 existing public buildings located in four regions of South Italy have been analysed, elaborated, and organised in a database. This was used to identify the best architectures of two ANNs and to train them. The first ANN provides the actual energy performance of any building; the second ANN assesses key economic indicators. A decision support tool, based on the use of these ANNs is conceived for a fast prediction of the energy performance of buildings and for a first selection of energy retrofit actions that can be applied.

AB District heating plays a crucial role in future energy systems due to its beneficial impacts on the overall flexibility and efficiency of the energy system as a whole. In order to fully utilize its benefits, the sizing and operation of said systems needs to be optimized. This is a computationally difficult task due to a large number of parameters that need to be considered and calculated. Another issue is a need for long optimization horizons of at least one year, in order to capture seasonal, and a small time step of 1 h or less, to capture intraday variations. The goal of this work has been the development and demonstration of an optimization model capable of handling both the sizing and the operation of a district heating system based on a heat only boiler, solar thermal collectors, electric heaters, heat pumps and thermal energy storage units while considering building refurbishment. The model has been implemented on nine scenarios. The results of the analysis have demonstrated the economic and environmental benefits of the utilization of highly efficient and renewable energy sources in the proposed system. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB The demand for hydrogen has greatly increased in the last decade due to the stringent regulations enacted to address environmental pollution concerns. Natural gas reforming is currently the most mature technology for large-scale hydrogen production. However, it is usually associated with greenhouse gas emissions. As part of the strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, new designs need to be developed to integrate hydrogen production facilities that are based on natural gas reforming with carbon capture facilities. In this study, we carried out energy, exergy and economic analysis of hydrogen production in a steam methane reforming reactor integrated with an oxy-combustion plant for co-production of power and hydrogen. The results show that the overall system efficiency and hydrogen production efficiency monotonically increase with increasing the combustor exit temperature (CET), increasing the amount of hydrogen extracted and decreasing the auxiliary fuel added to the system. The optimal thermo-economic operating conditions of the system were obtained as reformer pressure of 15 bar, auxiliary fuel factor of 0.8 and hydrogen extraction factor of 0.6. The production cost of hydrogen using the proposed system, under these optimal operating conditions, is within the range suggested by the International Energy Agency (IEA). Further analysis shows that the capital cost of the membrane-air separation unit (ITM) has the major share in the total investment cost of the system and constitutes 37% of the total capital cost of the system at the CET of 1500 K. The exergy analysis, at the optimal conditions, shows that the major exergy destruction components are the combustor, the exhaust gas condenser, the membrane-steam methane reformer and the heat recovery steam generator with 19.5%, 8.1% 6.3%, and 6.3% of the fuel exergy destroyed, respectively. The proposed system is economically feasible at hydrogen purchase price of $30/GJ and natural gas price of $10/GJ or less. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is an increasing debate on a new coal-fired power plant (CPP) construction over a demanding economic development and pressing environmental issues. A fundamental spatial analysis is required to identify potentially suitable sites, select a site and design a layout plan that are crucial for a sustainable energy development. The site selection and layout planning problems are mutually dependent. The different selection of the sites may lead to variations in the site layout plan, and vice versa. A proper site selection-layout planning solution is vital to the environmental, economic and social performances of a coal-fired thermal energy system. This study proposes a reconciling strategy to address the site selection and layout planning problems simultaneously. In specific, three types of conflicts in the site selection and layout planning processes are deliberately identified and quantified. To reconcile the conflicts, address practical constraints, and arrive at a "win-win" solution, three mechanisms are introduced and a bi-level multi-objective optimization model is established. Subsequently, a bi-level particle swarm optimization (BiPSO) is developed to generate an appropriate CPP site for the project owner and design an efficient site layout plan for the specialty subcontractor. The reconciling strategy is able to settle an agreement between the project owner and the subcontractor. To validate the applicability of the proposed method, a being-constructed CPP in China is used as a case study. The results demonstrate that it is an effective, robust and systematic method for decision makers to conduct a proper spatial analysis.

AB This paper focuses on the thermo-economic analysis of a 2.1-MWe and 960 kWt hybrid solar-biomass combined heat and power (CHP) system composed of a 1.4-MWe Externally Fired Gas-Turbine (EFGT) and a 0.7-MWe bottoming Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) power plant. The primary thermal energy input is provided by a hybrid Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) collector array covering a total ground area of 22,000-32,000 m(2), coupled to a biomass boiler. The CSP collector array is based on parabolic-trough concentrators (PTCs) with molten salts as the heat transfer fluid (HTF), upstream of a 4.5-9.1 MWt fluidized-bed furnace for direct biomass combustion. In addition, two molten-salt tanks are considered that provide 4.8-18 MWh (corresponding to 1.3-5.0 h) of Thermal Energy Storage (TES), as a means of reducing the variations in the plant's operating conditions, increasing the plant's capacity factor and total operating hours (from 5500-6000 to 8000 h per year). On the basis of the results of the thermodynamic simulations, upfront and operational costs assessments, and considering an Italian energy policy scenario (feed-in tariffs, or FiTs, for renewable electricity), the global energy conversion efficiency and investment profitability of this plant are estimated for different sizes of CSP and biomass furnaces, different operation strategies (baseload and modulating) and cogenerative vs. electricity-only system configurations. Upfront costs in the range 4.3-9.5 MEur are reported, with operating costs in the range 1.5-2.3 MEur annually. Levelized costs of energy from around 100 Eur/MWh to above 220 Eur/MWh are found, along with net present values (NPVs) from close to 13,000 to -3000 kEur and internal rates of return (IRRs) from 30% down to almost zero when prioritizing electrical power generation (i.e., not in cogenerative mode). In all cases the economic viability of the systems deteriorate for larger CSP section sizes. The results indicate the low economic profitability of CSP integration in comparison to biomass-only plants, due to high investment costs of the former, which are not compensated by the higher global energy conversion efficiency and energy sales revenues.

AB Reducing a building's energy consumption and providing better indoor environmental quality (IEQ) are the two major issues that building professionals are facing all over the world. It is not easy, however, to simultaneously address both issues. Therefore, this study aimed to establish the optimal occupant behavior that can simultaneously reduce total energy consumption and improve the IEQ, using an energy simulation and optimization tool. This study also developed an integrated IEQ score by combining three different IEQ indices (i.e., thermal comfort, indoor air quality (IAQ), and visual comfort) for building users to easily understand the IEQ condition. To analyze the effects of occupant behavior by region, the education facility was selected as the target facility, and five target regions were selected considering the Koppen climate classification system and the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. Finally, a total of 5 x 1.01 x 10(22) occupant behavior combinations can be generated in the five target regions. As a result, among the four target variables (i.e., total energy consumption, thermal comfort, IAQ and visual comfort), the total energy consumption of the optimal solution was found to have changed most dramatically compared to that of the basic condition in terms of percentage (94.7%), due to its strong correlation with the overall occupant behavior (the highest correlation coefficient: 0.879). Therefore, it is shown that occupant behavior has more influence on the total energy consumption than on the three IEQ indices. Among the three IEQ indices, the IAQ of the optimal solution decreased most significantly compared to that of the basic condition (the highest reduction ratio: 4.04% in Ulsan), which indicates that the IAQ has more influences on the integrated IEQ score than thermal and visual comfort. The facility manager and the building user can operate the building for reducing total energy consumption and improving the IEQ considering occupant behavior, which can be used as the building management guideline in various regions.

AB In order to recover waste heat from both exhaust gas and coolant water of engine, and improve system thermal efficiency, four CO2-based transcritical Rankine cycle (CTRC) systems with kW-scale power output were constructed, including a basic CTRC (B-CTRC), a CTRC with a regenerator (R-CTRC), a CTRC with a coolant pre heater (P-CTRC) and a CTRC with both the preheater and the regenerator (PR-CTRC). Experimental comparison between the four systems was presented based on an expansion valve, which can make system operate steadily and obtain the potential of net power output. Energy analysis, exergy analysis and cooling load analysis for the four systems were conducted at various pressure ratios. The results indicated that the PR-CTRC owned the highest potential of net power output, thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency, whose estimation reached up to 3.47 kW, 7.8% and 17.1%, respectively. In view of the linear fitting value at the same pressure ratio of 1.65, net power output, thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency of the PR-CTRC achieved increase of 100.6%, 69.6% and 79.5% versus that of the B-CTRC, respectively. Furthermore, the PR-CTRC required the lowest total cooling load jointly considering the engine and the CTRC system. The P-CTRC and the R-CTRC also had better thermodynamic performance than the B-CTRC did, but it was worse than that of the PR-CTRC. The preheater had more active effect on the power output, exergy efficiency and cooling load of the engine, and the regenerator contributed more to the thermal efficiency and cooling load of the CTRC. In summary, two main aspects of improvement for the engine were achieved by the PR-CTRC: thermal efficiency of the engine increased from 39.4% to 41.4% by the additional power output of bottoming system, and about 50% cooling load of the engine could be reduced and converted to preheat input of the CTRC system.

AB In the last decades, thermoeconomic analysis emerged as a combination of exergy analysis and cost accounting principles, widely used for multiple purposes: to account for the exergy and economic costs of energy systems products, to derive the structures of such costs for the design optimization purpose, and to perform system diagnosis quantifying the source and the impact of malfunctions and dysfunctions within the analyzed process. Traditionally, thermoeconomic analysis is referred to as Exergy Cost Analysis or Exergoeconomic Cost Analysis. The former is based on the so-called Exergy Cost Theory, focused on the evaluation of exergy cost of the system products, while the latter is focused on the evaluation of monetary cost following the same theory. Currently, many practical approaches are available in the literature for the application of thermoeconomic analysis and Exergy Cost Theory to energy conversion systems, while a comprehensive classification, benchmarking and comparison of such approaches is missing. This paper aims to fill this gap through the following activities: first of all, a brief but comprehensive literature review related to the theoretical developments and applications of thermoeconomic analysis method is performed. Secondly and for the purpose of benchmarking, the main practical approaches identified for the application of Exergy Cost Theory are presented and formalized, including the fundamental aspects related to the definition of auxiliary relations and the reallocation of the exergy cost of the residues. Finally, the identified approaches are comparatively applied to the standard CGAM problem, and the advantages and drawbacks of each approach are discussed.
   It is found that the definition of the functional diagram and the numerical solution of the system through input-output analysis seem to be more straightforward with respect to the other approaches, leading also to the formalization of an unambiguous method to reallocate the exergy cost of the residual flows.

AB This work proposes the multi-objective version of the recently proposed Multi-Verse Optimizer (MVO) called Multi-Objective Multi-Verse Optimizer (MOMVO). The same concepts of MVO are used for converging towards the best solutions in a multi-objective search space. For maintaining and improving the coverage of Pareto optimal solutions obtained, however, an archive with an updating mechanism is employed. To test the performance of MOMVO, 80 case studies are employed including 49 unconstrained multi-objective test functions, 10 constrained multi-objective test functions, and 21 engineering design multi-objective problems. The results are compared quantitatively and qualitatively with other algorithms using a variety of performance indicators, which show the merits of this new MOMVO algorithm in solving a wide range of problems with different characteristics.

AB This paper shows the differences between the design of a reinforced concrete structure considering two objectives to minimize; economic cost and CO2 emissions. Both objectives depend on the amount of two high carbon intensive materials: cement in the concrete and steel; therefore, these objectives are related. As the balance between steel and cement per m(3) of concrete depends on several factors such as the type of structure, this study focuses on buttressed earth-retaining walls. Another factor that determines the balance between steel and concrete is the height of the wall. Thus, the methodology considers a parametric study for optimal designs of buttressed earth-retaining walls, where one of the parameters is the wall height. One of the objectives is to show the variation in cost when CO2 is minimized, respectful of minimizing the economic cost. The findings show that wall elements under bending-compressive strains (i.e. the stem of the buttressed retaining wall) perform differently depending on the target function. On one hand, the study reveals an upward trend of steel per unit volume of concrete in emission-optimized earth-retaining buttressed walls, compared to the cost-optimized. On the other hand, it is checked that unlike the cost-optimized walls, emission-optimized walls opt for a higher concrete class than the minimum class available. These findings indicate that emission-optimized walls penalize not only concrete volume, but also the cement content, to the extent that a higher concrete class outperforms in reduced emissions. Additionally, the paper outlines how and to what extent the design of this typology varies for the two analyzed objectives in terms of geometry and amount of materials. Some relevant differences influencing the geometry of design strategies are found. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Multi-objective optimization (MOO) is at present widely used in the design and planning of sustainable systems where economic, environmental and social aspects must be considered simultaneously. The solution of a multi-objective model is given by a set of Pareto optimal points that feature the property that they cannot be improved in one objective without necessarily worsening at least another one. Identifying the best Pareto solution from this set is challenging, particularly when many objectives and decision-makers are involved in the analysis. In this work, we propose the first rigorous method (to the authors' knowledge) based on bilevel optimization to explore Pareto points that allows to: (i) identify in a systematic manner non-dominated solutions which are particularly appealing for decision-makers; (ii) quantify the distance between any (suboptimal) feasible point of a MOO model and its Pareto front (i.e. project suboptimal points onto the Pareto frontier); and (iii) establish improvement targets for suboptimal solutions of a MOO (through projection onto the Pareto front) that if attained would make them optimal. Overall, our method allows analysing Pareto fronts and selecting a final Pareto point to be implemented in practice without the need to define subjective weights in an explicit manner. We illustrate the capabilities of our approach through its application to the optimization of the UK electricity mix according to several economic, environmental and social indicators.

AB The problem-solving decision-making process often requires involvement of a group of individuals who have differing interests and conflicting multiple evaluation criteria. Therefore, the greatest concern in multiobjective group decision-making problems is how to arrive at a best decision that is agreeable to all the members of the group. Many previous studies focused on handling this concern based on decision rules, such as the consensus or ranking selection approaches. Although many contributions to the literature were made by past studies on this issue, disagreement remains on finding an effective way to address the subjectivity issue in group decision-making. This paper introduces a new approach called the preference clustering-based mediating group decision-making (PCM-GDM) method for minimizing the subjectivity issue. The PCM-GDM method basically employs two concepts: (1) clustering the preferences of the group members in a decision and (2) utilizing a mediating agent as a final decision-making tool. The new approach was applied to a case study of sample concrete bridge decks in the state of Indiana. The results of this study confirm that the proposed approach can significantly improve the multicriteria group decision-making results by providing a way to exclude biased judgments by decision-makers that can interfere with the development of one best alternative. The proposed approach advanced the reliability of the conventional decision-making knowledge, which is dependent on a consensus or the ranking of approaches by human experts to reach one solution.

AB This paper considers a multi-objective aircraft recovery problem for airline disruption. An integer programming formulation is first established based on connection network with three conflicting objectives, where the first objective minimizes the total deviation from original flight schedules, the second objective minimizes the maximal flight delay time, and the third objective minimizes the number of aircraft actually attended in swapping. Optimal analysis is provided for a small scale aircraft recovery problem with the last two objectives and then one polynomial time algorithm for aircraft recovery problem after the disruption to multi-aircraft in a fleet at an airport. One heuristic combined epsilon-constraints method and neighborhood search algorithm is designed for large scale disruption recovery problem. The results obtained from computational experiment illustrate effectiveness and efficiency of the heuristic. The outcome of this research could provide theoretical and practical supports for airlines to reduce flight delays. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the present paper, second order duality for multiobjective non-linear programming are investigated under the second order generalized (F, b, phi, rho, theta) - univex functions. The weak, strong and converse duality theorems are proved. Further, we also illustrated an example of (F, b, phi, rho, theta) - univex functions. Results obtained in this paper extend some previously known results of multiobjective nonlinear programming in the literature.

AB The current approach for technological projects must fulfill sustainability indexes. In this work, we use a multiobjective optimization framework to analyze the convenient product distribution in a lignocellulosic biorefinery, considering economic, environmental, and safety indexes. Corn cob was selected as feedstock due to the high annual volume produced as residue of maize crop. Products selection was based on the existing demand and economic value; bioethanol, lactic acid, succinic acid, xylitol, and lignosulfonates were chosen. Through the multiobjective optimization strategy an efficient solution with an Economic Potential Index of 0.16 is achieved, generating an annual utility of nearly 70 kUSD when bioethanol and xylitol production is favored over succinic acid and lactic acid. This tool can be applied with different feedstocks and products in a biorefinery scheme, with kinetic and yield data for corresponding processes.

AB In the last decades the scarcity of fossil fuels around the world has promoted the quest of new processes to produce power from alternative energy sources. The conventional Rankine cycle with water as working fluid is a good choice to convert heat into electricity, although it is inefficient for temperatures below 350 degrees C. Moreover, with the use of organic compounds mixtures as working fluid the Rankine cycle (called Organic Rankine Cycle) improves the cycle efficiency and the economy of the process for energy recovery from low temperature sources. In this work we propose a set of organic compounds to simultaneously obtain both optimum values of compositions of the mixture (used as working fluid) and optimal operating conditions of the cycle for a given low temperature source. As design goals we set the minimization of total annual cost and the maximization of thermal efficiency. Because these two goals are in conflict, the design problem was posed as a nonlinear multiobjective optimization problem with thermodynamic efficiency and total annual cost of the cycle as trade-off objective functions. In most cases binary mixtures are chosen for low cost and power ranges. On the other hand, as cycle efficiency improves, leading to expensive cycles, pure working fluids are preferred.

AB Poly(oxymethylene) dimethyl ethers (OME) are environmentally benign alternative fuels. This work presents the conceptual design of a novel OME process which employs aqueous solutions of formaldehyde and methanol as feedstock. In this process, OME of the desired chain lengths n = 3-5 and water are separated from the reactive mixture (formaldehyde + water + methanol + methylal + OME). Thermodynamic limits are identified by studying distillation boundaries and chemical equilibria. By that it is shown that OME of chain lengths n = 3-5 can be separated from the reactor outlet by distillation. The separation of water is carried out using either an adsorption or a membrane process. Adsorption isotherms of water on Zeolite 3A are determined experimentally. The OME process is simulated and optimized using a reduced process model accounting for the mass balances and the thermodynamic limits. Favorable operating points of the process are identified using multi-objective optimization.

AB In the past few years, more and more business-to-consumer and enterprise applications run in the heterogeneous clouds. Such cloud bag-of-tasks applications are usually budget constrained, and their scheduling is an essential problem for cloud provider. The problem is even more complex and challenging when the accurate knowledge about task execution time is unknown in advance. Focusing on these challenges, we first build a cloud resource management architecture and stochastic task model, which divides cloud task into two execution parts. Then, we deduce bag-of-tasks applications' schedule length (Makespan) and total cost according to heterogeneous clouds' online feedback information of task first part execution. Thirdly, we formulate this stochastic scheduling problem as a linear programming problem. Lastly, we propose a time and cost multiobjective stochastic task scheduling genetic algorithm, in which can find Pareto optimal schedules for stochastic cloud task that meet its budget constraint. The extensive simulation experiments were carried out on a heterogeneous cloud platform with 400 virtual machines, and tasks were derived from Parallel Workloads Archive and the analysis data of real-world cloud systems. The experimental results show that our proposed stochastic task scheduling genetic algorithm can get shorter schedule length and lower cost with task budget constraints.

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID DAILY VOLT/VAR CONTROL; DISTRIBUTION-SYSTEMS; OPTIMIZATION; GENERATION
AB The growing interest in distributed generation (DG) in recent years has led to a number of generators connected to a distribution system. The integration of DGs in a distribution system has resulted in a network known as active distribution network due to the existence of bidirectional power flow in the system. Voltage rise issue is one of the predominantly important technical issues to be addressed when DGs exist in an active distribution network. This paper presents the application of the backtracking search algorithm (BSA), which is relatively new optimisation technique to determine the optimal settings of coordinated voltage control in a distribution system. The coordinated voltage control considers power factor, onload tap-changer and generation curtailment control to manage voltage rise issue. A multiobjective function is formulated to minimise total losses and voltage deviation in a distribution system. The proposed BSA is compared with that of particle swarm optimisation (PSO) so as to evaluate its effectiveness in determining the optimal settings of power factor, tapchanger and percentage active power generation to be curtailed. The load flow algorithm from MATPOWER is integrated in the MATLAB environment to solve the multi-objective optimisation problem. Both the BSA and PSO optimisation techniques have been tested on a radial 13-bus distribution system and the results show that the BSA performs better than PSO by providing better fitness value and convergence rate.

AB Epistasis within disease-related genes (gene-gene interactions) was determined through contingency table measures based on multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Most MDR-based methods use the single contingency table measure to detect gene-gene interactions; however, some gene-gene interactions may require identification through multiple contingency table measures. In this study, a multiobjective differential evolution method (called MODEMDR) was proposed to merge the various contingency table measures based on MDR to detect significant gene-gene interactions. Two contingency table measures, namely the correct classification rate and normalized mutual information, were selected to design the fitness functions in MODEMDR. The characteristics of multiobjective optimization enable MODEMDR to use multiple measures to efficiently and synchronously detect significant gene-gene interactions within a reasonable time frame. Epistatic models with and without marginal effects under various parameter settings (heritability and minor allele frequencies) were used to assess existing methods by comparing the detection success rates of gene-gene interactions. The results of the simulation datasets show that MODEMDR is superior to existing methods. Moreover, a large dataset obtained from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium was used to assess MODEMDR. MODEMDR exhibited efficiency in identifying significant gene-gene interactions in genome-wide association studies.

AB Decision making in a composite system usually involves considering all of the components from which it is formed. In some cases, these components or subsystems may determine a part of the feasible set or they may impact the objectives of the whole system. This paper studies the relationship between the efficient set of the multiobjective problem associated with the composite system and the efficient sets of the multiobjective problems corresponding to the subsystems. In addition to simple examples appearing through this paper, the redundancy allocation problem is considered to illustrate the applicability of the results obtained.

AB A composite multiple-model approach based on multivariate Gaussian process regression (MGPR) with correlated noises is proposed in this paper. In complex industrial processes, observation noises of multiple response variables can be correlated with each other and process is nonlinear. In order to model the multivariate nonlinear processes with correlated noises, a dependent multivariate Gaussian process regression (DMGPR) model is developed in this paper. The covariance functions of this DMGPR model are formulated by considering the "between-data" correlation, the "between-output" correlation, and the correlation between noise variables. Further, owing to the complexity of nonlinear systems as well as possible multiple-mode operation of the industrial processes, to improve the performance of the proposed DMGPR model, this paper proposes a composite multiple-model DMGPR approach based on the Gaussian Mixture Model algorithm (GMM-DMGPR). The proposed modelling approach utilizes the weights of all the samples belonging to each sub-DMGPR model which are evaluated by utilizing the GMM algorithm when estimating model parameters through expectation and maximization (EM) algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed GMM-DMGPR approach is demonstrated by two numerical examples and a three-level drawing process of Carbon fiber production. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is a more efficient way to recover exhaust heat from medium-and small-scale gas turbines than conventional steam power cycles. Plate-fin heat exchangers (PFHEs) were applied as the evaporator and recuperators because gas-liquid and gas-gas heat transfers occurred. This study focused on the preliminary system design and off-design analysis of the gas turbine (GT)-ORC combined cycle. Therefore, optimum-rated parameters for the ORC and geometric parameters for the PFHEs were designed first. Based on the established off-design model and constant pressure control approach, off-design simulations were done and results showed that the combined cycle efficiency decreased monotonically with the decline of GT load. However, the ORC still had good performance and played a more important role in the combined cycle under low-load conditions. Moreover, sensitivity simulations concluded that the ambient temperature impacted the combined cycle performance mainly by the gas turbine under high-load conditions and the ORC under low-load conditions. In addition, the ORC had better performance with higher ambient temperature. This model can provide reference parameters for detailed design of the GT-ORC combined cycle and predict its off-design performance under variable conditions.

AB In this paper, a big data-based approach is proposed for the security improvement of an unplanned microgrid islanding (UMI). The proposed approach contains two major steps: the first step is big data analysis of wide-area monitoring to detect a UMI and locate it; the second step is particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based stability enhancement for the UMI. First, an optimal synchrophasor measurement device selection (OSMDS) and matching pursuit decomposition (MPD)-based spatial-temporal analysis approach is proposed to significantly reduce the volume of data while keeping appropriate information from the synchrophasor measurements. Second, a random forest-based ensemble learning approach is trained to detect the UMI. When combined with grid topology, the UMI can be located. Then the stability problem of the UMI is formulated as an optimization problem and the PSO is used to find the optimal operational parameters of the UMI. An eigenvalue-based multiobjective function is proposed, which aims to improve the damping and dynamic characteristics of the UMI. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. (c) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB Daylight illuminants are widely used as references for color quality testing and optical vision testing applications. Presently used daylight simulators make use of fluorescent bulbs that are not tunable and occupy more space inside the quality testing chambers. By designing a spectrally tunable LED light source with an optimal number of LEDs, cost, space, and energy can be saved. This paper describes an application of the generalized extremal optimization (GEO) algorithm for selection of the appropriate quantity and quality of LEDs that compose the light source. The multiobjective approach of this algorithm tries to get the best spectral simulation with minimum fitness error toward the target spectrum, correlated color temperature (CCT) the same as the target spectrum, high color rendering index (CRI), and luminous flux as required for testing applications. GEO is a global search algorithm based on phenomena of natural evolution and is especially designed to be used in complex optimization problems. Several simulations have been conducted to validate the performance of the algorithm. The methodology applied to model the LEDs, together with the theoretical basis for CCT and CRI calculation, is presented in this paper. A comparative result analysis of M- -GEO evolutionary algorithm with the Levenberg-Marquardt conventional deterministic algorithm is also presented.

AB In this paper, we propose an algorithm to obtain an approximation set of the (weakly) nondominated points of nonsmooth multiobjective optimization problems with equality and inequality constraints. We use an extension of the Wolfe duality to construct the separating hyperplane in Benson's outer algorithm for multiobjective programming problems with subdifferentiable functions. We also formulate an infinitive approximation set of the (weakly) nondominated points of biobjective optimization problems. Moreover, we provide some numerical examples to illustrate the advantage of our algorithm.

AB In this paper, we present an algorithm for generating approximate nondominated points of a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP), where the constraints and the objective functions are convex. We provide outer and inner approximations of nondominated points and prove that inner approximations provide a set of approximate weakly nondominated points. The proposed algorithm can be applied for differentiable or nondifferentiable convex MOPs. To illustrate efficiency of the proposed algorithm for convex MOPs, we provide numerical examples.

AB In order to satisfy the practical requirement of the power grid in China, this paper presents a multiobjective operation model for a cascaded hydropower system simultaneously considering the maximization of gross generation and firm output, as well as various complex constraints. Then, a multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) is presented here to solve this problem. This algorithm combines the merits of chaos theory, genetic operators, adaptive adjustment strategy, and the heuristic constraint-handling method to help the population explore the search space efficiently: the logistic map is introduced to generate the initial population distributed uniformly in problem space; both the inertia weight and learning coefficients are dynamically changed as iteration goes on; an archive set is used to conserve the non-dominated solutions found during evolution; the personal and global best position for each particle are determined by crowding distance and a feasibility-based dominance relationship; the classical mutation and crossover operators are introduced to enhance the population diversity; a novel constraint-handling method is proposed to address the complicated constraints. To testify to its effectiveness, the MOPSO is applied to the Wu River cascade hydropower system in southwest China. The results in different cases indicate that MOPSO is able to provide better solutions than the NSGA-II method, providing an effective technique for the operation of a hydropower system.

AB Pumped water storage (PWS) is an advanced component of interbasin water transfer (IBWT) projects that plays a critical role in addressing streamflow variability. However, improper operating rales result in a large amount of unnecessary pumping and spills, wasting water resources and energy. Here, multiobjective optimization (MO) was applied to develop effective operating rules for PWS with the objectives of minimizing the water shortage index and maximizing the net revenues of consumed and produced energy. A metaheuristic algorithm named cuckoo search was used to optimize the decision variables in the framework of parameterization-simulation-optimization. Additionally, the water diversion performance of PWS and parallel reservoirs (without pumped storage) were compared. The Han to Wei IBWT project in northwest China was selected for a case study. The results indicate that (1) the proposed MO model and adopted methods are effective for derivation of PWS operating rules, improving water use benefits and decreasing operational costs significantly; (2) the two optimization goals established in the MO model conflict (increasing water supply reliability will decrease the net revenue of energy); and (3) when the water diversion target is relatively small, parallel reservoirs outperform PWS; however, PWS is superior to parallel reservoirs when the water diversion target increases.

AB Managing energy, water, and environmental priorities and constraints within a cascade hydropower system is a challenging multiobjective optimization effort that requires advanced modeling and forecasting tools. Within the mid-Columbia River system, there is currently a lack of specific solutions for predicting how coordinated operational decisions can mitigate the impacts of total dissolved gas (TDG) supersaturation while satisfying multiple additional policy and hydropower generation objectives. In this study, a reduced-order TDG uptake equation is developed that predicts tailrace TDG at seven hydropower facilities on the mid-Columbia River. The equation is incorporated into a general multiobjective river, reservoir, and hydropower optimization tool as a prioritized operating goal within a broader set of system-level objectives and constraints. A test case is presented to assess the response of TDG and hydropower generation when TDG supersaturation is optimized to remain under state water-quality standards. Satisfaction of TDG as an operating goal is highly dependent on whether constraints that limit TDG uptake are implemented at a higher priority than generation requests. According to the model, an opportunity exists to reduce TDG supersaturation and meet hydropower generation requirements by shifting spillway flows to different time periods. A coordinated effort between all project owners is required to implement systemwide optimized solutions that satisfy the operating policies of all stakeholders.

AB Process planning is an important function in a manufacturing system; it specifies the manufacturing requirements and details for the shop floor to convert a part from raw material to the finished form. However, considering only economical criterion with technological constraints is not enough in sustainable manufacturing practice; formerly, criteria about low carbon emission awareness have seldom been taken into account in process planning optimization. In this paper, a mathematical model that considers both machining costs reduction as well as carbon emission reduction is established for the process planning problem. However, due to various flexibilities together with complex precedence constraints between operations, the process planning problem is a non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP) hard problem. Aiming at the distinctive feature of the multi-objectives process planning optimization, we then developed a hybrid non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA)-II to tackle this problem. A local search method that considers both the total cost criterion and the carbon emission criterion are introduced into the proposed algorithm to avoid being trapped into local optima. Moreover, the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is also adopted to determine the best solution from the Pareto front. Experiments have been conducted using Kim's benchmark. Computational results show that process plan schemes with low carbon emission can be captured, and, more importantly, the proposed hybrid NSGA-II algorithm can obtain more promising optimal Pareto front than the plain NSGA-II algorithm. Meanwhile, according to the computational results of Kim's benchmark, we find that both of the total machining cost and carbon emission are roughly proportional to the number of operations, and a process plan with less operation may be more satisfactory. This study will draw references for the further research on green manufacturing in the process planning level.

AB The multicriteria trajectory planning for space manoeuvre vehicle (SMV) is recognized as a challenging problem. Because of the nonlinearity and uncertainty in the dynamic model and even the objectives, it is hard for decision makers to balance all of the preference indices without violating strict path and box constraints. In this paper, to provide the designer an effective method and solve the trajectory hopping problem, an interactive fuzzy physical programming algorithm is introduced. A new multiobjective SMV optimal control problem is formulated and parameterized using an adaptive technique. By using the density function, the oscillations of the trajectory can be captured effectively. In addition, an interactive decision-making strategy is applied to modify the current designer's preferences during optimization process. Two realistic decision-making scenarios are conducted by using the proposed algorithm; Simulation results indicated that without driving objective functions out of the tolerable region, the proposed approach can have better performance in terms of the satisfactory degree compared with other approaches like traditional weighted-sum method, goal programming and fuzzy goal programming. Also, the results can satisfy the current preferences given by the decision makers. Therefore, the method is potentially feasible for solving multicriteria SMV trajectory planning problems.

AB In this paper, we answer two interleaved questions. The first one is, having a redundant serial manipulator with a given cyclic task, how can we benefit simultaneously from both natural dynamics modification (NDM) and kinematic redundancy resolution to reduce the actuators' torque? Here, the NDM is done by devising parallel nonlinear monoarticular compliances (MACs), which span one joint, and nonlinear biarticular compliances (BACs), which pass over two joints. We take advantage of kinematic redundancy to exploit the robot's natural dynamics. The second question is howdo kinematic redundancy resolution and the NDM interact to minimize the cost? To answer these questions, we cast the problem of simultaneous modification and exploitation of natural dynamics into a constrained multiobjective optimization problem. We show that the set of optimal compliances has an analytical solution as a parametric function of joint trajectories. Accordingly, we study how the components of cost function affect the profile of optimal compliant elements. The proposed method is implemented on a simulated planar 3-DoF manipulator and a simulated nonplanar 4-DoF manipulator for three different tasks. The results shed light on how kinematic redundancy resolution influences efficiency of using MACs and BACs and, consequently, increases attainable gains from the NDM. Moreover, analysis of the results specifies the roles of mono-and BACs and especially explains the reason behind the particular importance of having BACs to reduce the actuation cost.

AB It is widely accepted that device-to-device (D2D) communication is envisaged to become the key enabler of direct localized communication between mobile nodes in future wireless networks. However, little attention has been paid to an important aspect that can potentially affect both the performance of D2D and cellular transmissions, which is that of the D2D cell association. In this paper, a multiobjective cell association (MOCA) optimization framework for orchestrating a large number of D2D links in a multicell network is introduced. To this end, and without loss of generality, a differentiated Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) scheme is considered as the interference-limiting method, especially for cell-edge users, and we assume the provision of different resource pools for D2D and cellular users, which can vary according to their location. Under this assumption, we develop a set of integer linear programming optimization formulations for D2D links, part of which fall within the coverage area of different neighboring base stations. The main purpose is to achieve improved network traffic balancing via an efficient cell association scheme. Furthermore, we provide an iterative randomized resource allocation algorithm (i-RRA), which roots its logic on the differentiated FFR model in order to increase the overall network throughput. A wide set of numerical investigations demonstrate the benefits offered by MOCA, as well as the throughput gains that can be achieved through i-RRA, compared to existing solutions.

AB In this paper the reduced basis (RB) method is applied to solve quadratic multiobjective optimal control problems governed by linear parametrized variational equations. These problems often arise in applications, where the quality of the system behavior has to be measured by more than one criterium. The weighted sum method is exploited for defining scalar-valued linear-quadratic optimal control problems built by introducing additional optimization parameters. The optimal controls corresponding to specific choices of the optimization parameters are efficiently computed by the RB method. The accuracy is guaranteed by an a-posteriori error estimate. An effective sensitivity analysis allows to further reduce the computational times for identifying a suitable and representative set of optimal controls.

AB The building sector is one of the largest energy consumers in the world, comprising about 40% of the total energy consumption in numerous countries. Early design decisions have a significant impact on the energy performance of buildings. The paper presents the multi-variable optimization of the selected design parameters in a single-family building in temperate climate conditions. The influence of four types of windows, their size, building orientation, insulation of external wall, roof and ground floor and infiltration on the life cycle costs (LCC) is analyzed. Optimal selection of the design parameters is carried out using genetic algorithms by coupling the building performance simulation program EnergyPlus with optimization environment. The simulations were conducted for seven optimization cases. The analysis is performed for two variants of a building with heating and cooling systems and with a heating system only. Depending on the analyzed case, the life cycle costs decreased from 7% to 34% LCC value of the reference building. In the case of temperate climate, the building optimization (in terms of heat demand only) substantially reduces the heating costs, yet the summer thermal comfort conditions deteriorate significantly.

AB The Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is a promising form of technology for recovering low-grade waste heat. In this study, a regenerative ORC system is established to recover the waste flue gas of 160 degrees C. Focusing on thermodynamic and economic performance while simultaneously considering the limitations of volume flow ratio (VFR) and the effect of superheat, working fluid selection and parameter optimization have been investigated. The optimization of the evaporation temperature is carried out by analyzing the variation of net power output and specific investment cost (SIC). Then, the net power output, specific net power output, total exergy destruction rate, VFR, total capital cost, and levelized electricity cost (LEC) are selected as criteria, and a fuzzy multi-criteria evaluation method is adopted to select a more suitable working fluid and determine the optimal degree of superheat. In addition, the preheating coefficient, latent heat coefficient, superheating coefficient, and internal heat coefficient were proposed to explore the effect of working fluid critical temperature on thermal efficiency. Research studies demonstrate that there is an optimal evaporation temperature, maximizing net power output and minimizing the SIC. Isohexane and butane have greater specific net power output due to greater latent heat. A suitable degree of superheat is not only conducive to improving the working capacity of working fluids, but also reduces the VFR, total capital cost, SIC, and LEC for different working fluids. Thus, the system's thermodynamic and economic performanceas well as the operational stabilityare improved. Among the six working fluids, butane exhibits the best comprehensive performance, and its optimal evaporation temperature and degree of superheat are 100 degrees C and 5 degrees C, respectively.

AB This paper proposes a Mixed Integer Conic Programming (MICP) model for community microgrids considering the network operational constraints and building thermal dynamics. The proposed multi-objective optimization model optimizes not only the operating cost, including fuel cost, electricity purchasing/selling, storage degradation, voluntary load shedding and the cost associated with customer discomfort as a result of the room temperature deviation from the customer setting point, but also several performance indices, including voltage deviation, network power loss and power factor at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC). In particular, we integrate the detailed thermal dynamic model of buildings into the distribution optimal power flow (D-OPF) model for the optimal operation. Thus, the proposed model can directly schedule the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems of buildings intelligently so as to to reduce the electricity cost without compromising the comfort of customers. Results of numerical simulation validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and significant savings in electricity cost with network operational constraints satisfied.

AB With the growing concerns about food security around the world, there is a need to develop sustainable strategies and proactive measures especially in developing countries with disenfranchised communities. These strategies must account for the specific nature and resources of each community and should be integrated with the need for economic growth. This work presents a conceptual framework and a mathematical programming model for the strategic planning of a sustainable food assistance program to satisfy the nutritional needs of disenfranchised communities while taking into account the objective of economic growth and the constraints of local resources. A case study from Mexico is presented as an example of applying the proposed approach. Fourteen municipalities with the lowest human development index are considered. The results show that it is possible to satisfy the nutritional needs while simultaneously improving the local economy of these disenfranchised communities.

AB Acquisition granularity and acquisition span are two important indexes to analyze the active power of renewable energy power stations, and it is important for the analysis of the intermittent energy output power to determine the acquisition granularity of the data. An acquisition granularity calibration method of the photovoltaic output power based on data mining technology is proposed in this paper. The sensitivity changing characteristics of the time series and the sum of the output power are respectively extracted by the multi-scale descriptive statistical analysis and interpolation method. A "power trapezoidal continuous changing state" method is proposed to establish a multi-objective optimization model for the acquisition granularity calibration of the photovoltaic output power. Genetic algorithm (GA) and Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm are respectively used to solve the model and determine the optimal acquisition granularity of the photovoltaic output power. The sensitivity of the acquisition granularity of the data to the capacity of the energy storage system is analyzed, and the energy storage system with the optimal acquisition granularity can't only effectively smooth the fluctuation of the photovoltaic output power but also keep the main information of the data. The simulation tests of the annual actual operation data at a photovoltaic power station with the installed capacity of 14 MW in China verify the validity of the model. The simulation results show when the acquisition granularity of the photovoltaic output power takes 45 s, it can satisfy the accuracy of the required data for the capacity configuration of the energy storage system. The method proposed in this paper provides a theoretical basis for the intermittent energy applications and has a certain engineering application prospects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Portfolio management based on mean-variance portfolio optimization is subject to different sources of uncertainty. In addition to those related to the quality of parameter estimates used in the optimization process, investors face a portfolio implementation risk. The potential temporary discrepancy between target and present portfolios, caused by trading strategies, may expose investors to undesired risks. This study proposes an evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm aiming at regions with solutions more tolerant to these deviations and, therefore, more reliable. The proposed approach incorporates a user's preference and seeks a fine-grained approximation of the most relevant efficient region. The computational experiments performed in this study are based on a cardinality-constrained problem with investment limits for eight broad-category indexes and 15 years of data. The obtained results show the ability of the proposed approach to address the robustness issue and to support decision making by providing a preferred part of the efficient set. The results reveal that the obtained solutions also exhibit a higher tolerance to prediction errors in asset returns and variance-covariance matrix.

AB In modern logistics chain, planning system which been applied for supporting daily operations, is becoming more information-intensive and technologically-dependent. Due to the growing operational complexities, the planning system is not only required to focus on ensuring the feasibility of daily plan, but also be capable of manipulating conflict of interest (COI) by exploiting efficient negotiation. This paper addresses a challenge of hinterland transport planning caused by limited information sharing, lack of collaboration and COI. We design collaboration and decision-making mechanisms for the implementation of autonomous control by means of multi agent technology and hybrid heuristics. It aims at providing quality plan to achieve high level of performance and robustness in hinterland logistics. From a system point of view, a service oriented architecture is proposed to integrate agent paradigm with a web-based planning system. From an operational point of view, special attentions are paid on establishing multi-dimensional collaborations between different stakeholders under the support of game theoretic approach. Specifically, we define how planning activities are executed, which level of collaborations are incorporated and how benefits are achieved with a global point of view. Due to the NP-hard nature of the addressed problem, an integrated NGSA-II and simulated annealing algorithm is implemented for assisting decision making. The parameters associated with the algorithm are tuned based on the Taguchi method. Case and comparative study will be presented to validate the appropriateness and performance of the approach.

AB In real manufacturing systems there are many combinatorial optimization problems (COP) imposing on more complex issues with multiple objectives. However it is very difficult for solving the intractable COP problems by the traditional approaches because of NP-hard problems. For developing effective and efficient algorithms that are in a sense "good," i.e., whose computational time is small as within 3 min, we have to consider three issues: quality of solution, computational time and effectiveness of the nondominated solutions for multiobjective optimization problem (MOP).
   In this paper, we focus on recent hybrid evolutionary algorithms (HEA) to solve a variety of single or multiobjective scheduling problems in manufacturing systems to get a best solution with a smaller computational time. Firstly we summarize multiobjective hybrid genetic algorithm (Mo-HGA) and hybrid sampling strategy-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (HSS-MoEA) and then propose HSS-MoEA combining with differential evolution (HSS-MoEA-DE). We also demonstrate those hybrid evolutionary algorithms to bicriteria automatic guided vehicle (B-AGV) dispatching problem, robot-based assembly line balancing problem (R-ALB), bicriteria flowshop scheduling problem (B-FSP), multiobjective scheduling problem in thin-film transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) module assembly and bicriteria process planning and scheduling (B-PPS) problem. Also we demonstrate their effectiveness of the proposed hybrid evolutionary algorithms by several empirical examples. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Finding near-optimal solutions in an acceptable amount of time is a challenge when developing sophisticated approximate approaches. A powerful answer to this challenge might be reached by incorporating intelligence into metaheuristics. We propose integrating two methods into Meta-RaPS (Metaheuristic for Randomized Priority Search), which is currently classified as a memoryless metaheuristic. The first method is the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA), and the second is utilizing a machine learning algorithm known as Q-Learning. To evaluate their performance, the proposed algorithms are tested on the 0-1 Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP). Meta-RaPS EDA appears to perform better than Meta-RaPS Q-Learning. However, both showed promising results compared to other approaches presented in the literature for the 0-1 MKP. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Direct nucleation control (DNC) is a model-free feedback control approach based on the measurement of particle number in the crystallization process. The experimental implementation has demonstrated that this approach is efficient to produce large and uniform crystals in batch crystallization, or to reduce startup duration and suppress disturbance in continuous crystallization. In this work, five different DNC frameworks/strategies are proposed for a continuous mixed suspension mixed product removal (MSMPR) crystallization of paracetamol water system and evaluated systematically using a model based approach. It is found that the reverse DNC framework could provide the best control performance in terms of startup, set-point change, and disturbance suppression. In addition, an optimal heating/cooling rate of about 0.6 degrees C/min was determined. These observations are applicable for the model compound studied (paracetamol) and should be investigated for other systems. This study provides a general guidance of designing a DNC framework with the best control performance for continuous MSMPR crystallization.

AB The therapeutic effects of drugs are well known to result from their interaction with multiple intracellular targets. Accordingly, the pharma industry is currently moving from a reductionist approach based on a 'one-target fixation' to a holistic multitarget approach. However, many drug discovery practices are still procedural abstractions resulting from the attempt to understand and address the action of biologically active compounds while preventing adverse effects. Here, we discuss how drug discovery can benefit from the principles of evolutionary biology and report two real-life case studies. We do so by focusing on the desirability principle, and its many features and applications, such as machine learning-based multicriteria virtual screening.

AB This investigation focuses on the multiobjective optimization of a crash box subjected to static loading by using a validated numerical model and an analytical approach. The crash box is made with a unique combination of three materials: an aluminium tube filled with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) foam and a glass-fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) skeleton. A finite element model was calibrated based on the results obtained in a material testing campaign using appropriate constitutive equations. A J2-plasticity model was used for the material behaviour of the aluminium alloy, and the PET foam was modelled using Deshpande and Fleck's model. Regarding the short fibres GFRP, a Voce plasticity model was fitted to the experimental data. After a successful validation of the finite element model, the filled aluminium tube was subjected to a structural optimization to achieve the best crash performance. Three relevant design variables were selected: the thickness of the outer aluminium cylinder, the thickness of the GFRP and the density of the PET foam, the last being related to the crushing strength of the foam. Given the high computational cost of each finite element model, a multi-adaptive regression splines metamodel was fitted to a large-scale sampling. Optimum pairs were obtained for the absorbed energy, the specific energy absorption, the peak load and the mass of the component; stating the relative contribution of each design variable to the crashworthiness of the crash box and enabling the choice of a balanced optimum design. A semi-empirical model based on Hanssen's interaction formula was calibrated with the data from a validated finite element model. This analytical model was able to reproduce the behaviour of the component over the design region selected for the optimization, and was also used for its optimization with satisfactory results.

AB In this study, the effect of foam fill ratio on the energy absorption capacity of axially compressed thin-walled multi-cell square and circular tubes is investigated. In the experimental study, Aluminum tubes having circular cross-sections with four different foam fill ratio (11.4%, 22.8%, 34.2%, 100%) were subjected to compression tests under quasi-static test conditions. The finite element (FE) models of these tests were prepared and FE analysis were conducted using LS-DYNA program for validation study. After validating the FE models with real experiments, a total of 24 different multi-cell geometries (6 square empty, 6 square with various foam fill ratio, 6 circular empty and 6 circular with various foam fill ratio) were created. A total of three different wall thicknesses were used for each geometry in the explicit dynamic analyses. It is found out that specific energy absorption (SEA) of foam-filled square design is 5 times larger compared to the empty square design which has minimum SEA. By varying the wall thickness, the SEA and crush force efficiency (CFE) performances of the foam-filled square design can be increased by 87% and 42% respectively. The main goal of this study is to find the best multi-cell design having maximum SEA and CFE. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a novel heuristic optimization approach using population variant differential evolution algorithm for solving the multiobjective economic emission load dispatch (EELD) problem. The EELD problem simultaneously takes into consideration the effect of gaseous pollutants like NOx, SOx, etc, including the cost of the fossil fuel used in the thermal power plants. A population refreshment mechanism, based on the concept of interquartile range, has been applied to the classical differential evolution method to compute the EELD problem successfully. The algorithm has been tested on IEEE-30 bus 6-generator test system and a standard 40-generator test system, taking valve point loading effects into consideration for effective solutions. The results have been compared with the standard existing techniques in the literature such as linear programming, multiobjective stochastic search technique, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm, fuzzy clustering particle swarm optimization, and modified bacterial foraging algorithm, which authenticate the capability of the proposed algorithm. A novel concept of applying the proposed methodology to a deregulated power market has also been presented in this paper, where successful results have been obtained. This method appears as an efficient and robust optimization algorithm in terms of minimizing the total cost, emission, and computational time.

AB Transient voltage stability (TVS) is an important issue for security operation with the development of power system topology and loads. Lots of research on reactive power planning mainly focus on static voltage stability. But the research on the dynamic reactive power planning considering TVS is very lacking so far. And most of them are only analyzed on some serious buses without covering all the weak faults. And some research considering TVS are limited under some conditions and not general enough for large-scale applications. Therefore, it is an urgent task to propose a feasible dynamic reactive power planning methodology to enhance TVS. So a novel dynamic reactive power planning methodology is proposed in this paper. In addition, although some TVS assessment indices have been proposed, they may not be suitable to be used in dynamic reactive power planning in the iteration calculation. To evaluate voltage stability after contingencies, a TVS assessment index is presented. Then an approach based on compensation sensitivity analysis is discussed for the best dynamic volt ampere reactive planning candidate locations. And a dynamic reactive power planning optimization methodology based on the memetic immune algorithm for multiobjective optimization is proposed to enhance TVS with the least static volt ampere reactive compensator investment cost and power loss cost. The methodology can cover all faults through random faults selection in the optimization. Afterwards, IEEE 39 power system and Zhejiang power grid in China are illustrated and analyzed for the improvement of TVS. It is proved that the proposed dynamic reactive power planning methodology is effective and beneficial to the security operation for power system.

AB For solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) development, load tracking, heat management, air excess ratio constraint, high efficiency, low cost and fault diagnosis are six key issues. However, no literature studies the control techniques combining optimization and fault diagnosis for the SOFC system. An optimal fault-tolerant control strategy is presented in this paper, which involves four parts: a fault diagnosis module, a switching module, two backup optimizers and a controller loop. The fault diagnosis part is presented to identify the SOFC current fault type, and the switching module is used to select the appropriate backup optimizer based on the diagnosis result. NSGA-II and TOPSIS are employed to design the two backup optimizers under normal and air compressor fault states. PID algorithm is proposed to design the control loop, which includes a power tracking controller, an anode inlet temperature controller, a cathode inlet temperature controller and an air excess ratio controller. The simulation results show the proposed optimal fault-tolerant control method can track the power, temperature and air excess ratio at the desired values, simultaneously achieving the maximum efficiency and the minimum unit cost in the case of SOFC normal and even in the air compressor fault.

AB This paper presents a study of multi-objective optimization of elastic beams with minimum weight and radiated sound power. The goal of this research is to discover the potentials to design multi-objective optimal elastic structures for better acoustic performance. We discuss various structural-acoustic properties of the Pareto solutions of the multiobjective optimization problem (MOP). We have found that geometrical and dynamic constraints can substantially reduce the volume fraction of feasible solutions in the design space, which can make it difficult to search for the optimal solutions. Several case studies with different boundary conditions are studied to demonstrate the multi-objective optimal designs of the structure.

AB Water resource management poses a challenge in the process industry because a large amount of water must be used, even when prices increase. Companies struggle to minimize consumption by reusing wastewater, and the resulting water-reuse-network problem has been actively investigated. With the rising impact of global climate change, it is necessary to develop a sustainable methodology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the process industry. This paper proposes a mathematical model for sustainable water reuse networks that explicitly considers CO2 emissions. To construct a sustainable network, emissions due to the construction and operation of the water network and additional water demand due to CO2 capture facilities are incorporated. Actual case studies of steel manufacturing processes and eco-industrial parks are presented to illustrate the applicability of the model.

AB An iterative synthesizing strategy for robust force reflecting control of a Haptic exploration device is proposed. The proposed strategy guarantees the robust stability of the closed loop system with respect to uncertainties caused by the robot dynamics and environmental impedance as well as time-varying communication delays. In order to achieve the stability and performance objectives of the teleoperation system through a multiobjective optimization framework, a suboptimal robust controller is obtained with guaranteed global stability. Under a decentralized structure, the proposed approach provides a systematic design framework using H-infinity robust approach in the presence of interconnection in the structure. Through experimental results, the improved performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article introduces a novel method to improve energy absorption performance of thin-walled columns with square and rectangular cross-sections subjected to distributed quasi-static lateral compression loading during different lateral flattening processes. Firstly, some square and rectangular columns made of aluminum and brass alloys are compressed in the axial direction to transform them into folded columns. Then, the folded specimens are used in four different lateral energy absorption processes as initial samples. All the lateral flattening tests are carried out between rigid platens. All the used specimens in the four flattening processes are prepared by initial simple square and rectangular columns. In one flattening process, the simple quadrangular specimens are used. In the second process as a novel flattening process, the folded samples are tested. Furthermore, in two other processes, the initial specimens of the novel flattening processes are prepared by folding and cutting the simple quadrangular specimens. Effects of different parameters consist of material type, wall thickness, cross-sectional aspect ratio, and length of the specimens and also, flattening process type and lateral loading direction are discussed on energy absorption performance of the quadrangular specimens. Totally, the performed experiments show that the new lateral energy absorption processes increase specific absorbed energy by the quadrangular specimens up to 7 times; and enhance their total absorbed energy more than 13 times of the corresponding simple specimens.

AB The axial crushing of Functionally Graded Thickness (FGT) tubes under external inversion process is studied analytically, and their results have been checked with experimental and Finite Element (FE) simulation results. Employing doubly curved shell theory and using rigid-perfectly plastic (R-PP) material idealization, a theoretical solution is derived for the crushing inversion load of a variable thickness distribution tube. Experimental tests are carried out by employing tubes with linearly variable thickness distribution, and their results compared with analytical model. It is seen that the obtained results from experiments and theoretical model show excellent agreement. To evaluate nonlinear thickness patterns behavior, numerical simulations are carried out using the explicit FE code LSDYNA. It was found that FE simulations and theoretical analysis have reasonable correlation. Finally, the study was extended to find out the most accurate loads of thickness functions that the proposed theoretical model is predicted. The results show that the predicted theoretical loads of concave and linear thickness distribution have more precision with respect to convex function based on the FE and experimental results.

AB The approach of this paper is based on the evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) of very thin noise barrier models with improved performance idealized as single wire designs. To assume such a simplification of reality, the dual boundary element (DBE) formulation for assessing the acoustic efficiency arises as the most appropriate strategy involving BE to avoid drawbacks associated with the exclusive implementation of the standard formulation (SBE). The 2D analysis performed in this work focuses on the simultaneous optimization of two objectives in conflict using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II): the maximization of noise attenuation and the minimization of the amount of material used in manufacturing the barrier, represented by the overall length of its elements (this function is, closely related to the final cost of the device). Under this framework, two optimization strategies are compared for each model with equal number of fitness evaluations: (1) when considering a random initial population and (2) when including the best single-objective optimal design in the initial population. The results obtained show wide and uniformly spread-out non-dominated fronts, reflected in the geometric diversity featured by optimal designs; statistical analysis confirm the advantages of the latter initial population strategy.

AB Robust optimization is a popular method to tackle uncertain optimization problems. However, traditional robust optimization can only find a single solution in one run which is not flexible enough for decision-makers to select a satisfying solution according to their preferences. Besides, traditional robust optimization often takes a large number of Monte Carlo simulations to get a numeric solution, which is quite time-consuming. To address these problems, this paper proposes a parallel double-level multi objective evolutionary algorithm (PDL-MOEA). In PDL-MOEA, a single-objective uncertain optimization problem is translated into a bi-objective one by conserving the expectation and the variance as two objectives, so that the algorithm can provide decision-makers with a group of solutions with different stabilities. Further, a parallel evolutionary mechanism based on message passing interface (MPI) is proposed to parallel the algorithm. The parallel mechanism adopts a double-level design, i.e., global level and sub-problem level. The global level acts as a master, which maintains the global population information. At the sub-problem level, the optimization problem is decomposed into a set of sub-problems which can be solved in parallel, thus reducing the computation time. Experimental results show that PDL-MOEA generally outperforms several state-of-the-art serial/parallel MOEAs in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB One of the approaches to combinatorial optimization is to use global search methods, such as evolutionary algorithms combined with local search procedures. Local search can be very effective in improving the quality of solutions, however, searching large neighbourhoods can be computationally expensive. In this paper a new local search method is described that is dedicated to the Firefighter Problem (FFP). The Firefighter Problem concerns protecting nodes of a graph in order to stop a threat that is spreading in the graph. Because the resources used for protection are limited, the goal is to find the best order in which the nodes are protected and thus the FFP is a combinatorial optimization problem. One of the key elements in the design of a local search method is the definition of the neighbourhoods of solutions from which the local search starts. The method proposed in this paper (ED-LS) aims at lowering the computational cost of the local search by reducing, based on certain heuristics, the size of these neighbourhoods.
   In this paper the ED-LS is compared to an optimization without the local search, a local search using non-reduced neighbourhoods and a method that reduces the neighbourhood by checking only some randomly selected neighbours. The results show that the ED-LS improves the performance of the algorithm with respect to no local search at all and to the local search using non-reduced neighbourhoods, supporting the view that reducing the size of the neighbourhood is beneficial. Also, the ED-LS produces better results than when the size of the neighbourhood is reduced randomly, which means that the proposed heuristics are indeed selecting promising neighbours effectively. In the last part of the experiments the ED-LS is further improved to obtain faster improvement of solutions at the beginning of the optimization run. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Psychological response based on the indoor environmental quality (IEQ) condition changes and activities of the occupants, can be assessed via indoor air quality (IAQ) satisfaction and thermal comfort. However, it is difficult to analyze both indices at the same time because they are measured on different scales. Therefore, this study aimed to develop an integrated psychological response score of the occupants based on 22 experimental participants' activities and the IEQ condition changes by using the weighted Euclidean distance. For this purpose, the experiment was designed with three scenarios to simulate the IEQ condition changes (i.e., CO2 concentration and operative temperature) during an 8-h working period. In each scenario, six cognitive tasks that simulate office work were performed to consider the activities of the occupants. A questionnaire survey on IAQ satisfaction and thermal comfort was conducted before and after (i) office work and (ii) IEQ condition changes. As a result, when the operative temperature was changed from 18.70 degrees C (cold) to 25 degrees C (neutral), the best psychological response score was calculated as 0.335. In addition, the occupants were more affected by the operative temperature than the CO2 concentration. It was shown that the mental health status based on IEQ condition, while considering both the indoor air pollutant and indoor climate, could be expressed as a single index. The mechanical system designer and facility manager can design or operate the IEQ condition considering the integrated psychological response score of the occupants, which can be used as an IEQ condition management guideline for mental health.

AB Finding life cycle optimized building designs is a challenging task. It requires the inclusion of all phases of the building life cycle in a single optimization problem. The present study demonstrates a life cycle simulation-based optimization approach, by including the operational carbon footprint (OCF) and embodied carbon footprint (ECF) of a building. Particularly, finding and analyzing the difference between life cycle (OCF + ECF) optimized design and operational (only OCF) performance-based optimized design is the primary goal of the current study. The life cycle optimization method is applied to a townhouse in Finland to determine carbon-cost optimal designs. Different options of building envelope insulation thicknesses, window types, heating systems, heat recovery units, and PV area are explored as design variables. It has been found that the heating system is a dominant design variable, which results in clearly separated pareto fronts for each system. Generally, a majority of the design variables' optimal values, obtained from OCF + ECF optimization, suggest thinner insulation for the building envelope and a larger PV area, compared to the optimal solutions from OCF optimization. In a carbon optimal solution, the share of ECF is 39% of the life cycle carbon footprint, whereas in a cost optimal solution, the share of ECF is 28% of the life cycle carbon footprint.

AB The simulation-based design of chemical processes with an overlaid multi-objective optimization is of growing importance. The quality of the determined optimization results, referred to as the Pareto front, influences directly the variety of solutions given to the decision maker. In case of the frequently used genetic algorithms, a lot of studies have been done for a precise approximation of the Pareto front. However, most of the developed methods are inconvenient and/or time-consuming and, thus, inappropriate for industrial applications. A novel approach, the two-step optimization, was successfully tested in order to overcome these challenges.

AB Sustainable processes have recently awaked an increasing interest in the process systems engineering literature. In industry, this kind of problems inevitably required a multi-objective analysis to evaluate the environmental impact in addition to the economic performance. Bio-based processes have the potential to enhance the sustainability level of the energy sector. Nevertheless, such processes very often show variable conditions and present an uncertain behavior. The approaches presented for solving multi objective problems under uncertainty have neglected the potential effects of different quality streams on the overall system. Here, it is presented an alternative approach, based on a State Task Network formulation, capable of optimizing under uncertain conditions, considering multiple selection criteria and accounting for the material quality effect. The resulting set of Pareto solutions are then assessed using the Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality-IV method, which identify the ones showing better overall performance considering the uncertain parameters space.

AB Analog CMOS integrated circuits (ICs) designs depend typically on designer knowledge and experience, as such problems are multivariate and multiobjective, presenting many combinations of input variables to be investigated in order to meet the required specifications. Nowadays, the a posteriori approach is widely used to perform the optimization processes of analog CMOS ICs using evolutionary algorithms. However, these techniques are not totally able to explore potential solutions in specific regions of the Pareto front. Designers then have difficulty in choosing the best solution capable of achieving all desired specifications simultaneously among all the ones found. In this context, the a priori approach using fitness functions has become an important alternative method to overcome these issues of the a posteriori methodology. This paper aims to compare different fitness function profiles used in the a priori optimization processes to boost the effectiveness of the search processes in relation to robustness, accuracy, and yield in analog CMOS ICs designs. We show that the Gaussian profile, proposed here, applied to the lower limit, center value, and upper limit fitness functions is able to improve all the a priori optimization evolutionary techniques investigated, including the genetic, imperialist competitive, and shuffled frog leaping algorithms.

AB In numerous industrial applications where safety, efficiency, and reliability are among primary concerns, condition-based maintenance (CBM) is often the most effective and reliable maintenance policy. Prognostics, as one of the key enablers of CBM, involves the core task of estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of the system. Neural networks-based approaches have produced promising results on RUL estimation, although their performances are influenced by handcrafted features and manually specified parameters. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective deep belief networks ensemble (MODBNE) method. MODBNE employs a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm integrated with the traditional DBN training technique to evolve multiple DBNs simultaneously subject to accuracy and diversity as two conflicting objectives. The eventually evolved DBNs are combined to establish an ensemble model used for RUL estimation, where combination weights are optimized via a single-objective differential evolution algorithm using a task-oriented objective function. We evaluate the proposed method on several prognostic benchmarking data sets and also compare it with some existing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.

AB This work aims at comparing the optimization of an AISI-52100-steel turning process with a wiper tool attained through the use of the weighted multivariate mean square error (MMSE) method and that obtained through the use of the MMSE. Both of these methods combine principal component analysis and response surface methodology, with the difference that the weighted approach allows the assignment of different degrees of importance to each response. Three input factors were considered: cutting speed (V-c), feed rate (f) and depth of cut (d). Six highly correlated output characteristics (process responses) were considered: tool life (T), cutting time (C-t), total turning cycle time (T-t), processing cost per piece (K-p), arithmetic mean roughness (R-a) and maximum peak to valley roughness (R-t). It should be kept in mind that the material removal rate was a constraint of the problem and not a dependent factor, as a means to guarantee the existence of a minimum productivity. The multiobjective optimization results have been validated experimentally. All models developed in this study, both for turning outputs and for principal component scores, are then suitable for predicting and controlling turning processes similar to that studied here.

AB A mixed ceramic is a type of cutting-tool material widely employed for machining hardened steels. The usage of a mixed ceramic along with a wiper geometry can help double the feed rate, thereby increasing productivity while keeping the surface roughness (Ra) as low as possible. Analyses of manufacturing processes, such as a machining process, show that the various possible controlled parameters can be modeled by multiobjective mathematical models to ensure their optimization. Hence, the aim of this study was optimize a hard turning process using a robust weighting based on diversity to choose the final Pareto optimal solution of the multiobjective problem. The responses of the material removal rate (MRR), Ra parameter, and cutting force (Pc) were modeled by using the response surface methodology; in this methodology, decision variables, such as the cutting speed (Vc), feed rate (f), and depth of cut (d), are employed. The diversity index, as a decision-making criterion, proved to be useful in mapping the regions of minimum variance within the Pareto optimal responses obtained in the optimization process. Hence, the study demonstrates that the weights used in the multiobjective optimization process influence the prediction variance of the obtained response. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Turning with rotary tool is a newly developed alternative of the conventional turning process in which cutting edge of a round insert rotates about its axis, so that a continuously indexed cutting edge is fed into the cutting zone. In the present study, a longitudinal high-frequency vibration was superimposed to the rotary tool to analyze the cutting force and surface roughness of AA7075 during orthogonal cutting. However, due to contribution of wide ranges of factors in the vibratory-rotary turning process, the selection of optimal parameter setting is a challenge that is faced with this process. In the present work, an attempt was made to simultaneously minimize machining force (F-z) and surface roughness (Ra) through selection of the optimal setting of cutting velocity, feed rate, tool rotary speed in rotary turning, and vibratory-rotary turning operations. Here, grey relational analysis was used to find the optimal parameter setting in rotary turning and vibratory-rotary turning processes, separately. Then the obtained solutions were compared. Results indicated that applying axial vibration to the rotary tool turning significantly reduced both surface roughness and cutting force. From the optimization by the grey relational analysis method, it was obtained that for both rotary turning and vibratory-rotary turning operations, setting of 4m/min cutting velocity, 220r/min tool rotary speed, 0.08mm/rev feed rate, and 0.3mm depth of cut are the most-optimal solutions that causes minimum F-z and Ra, simultaneously. Also, the vibratory-rotary turning process had higher values of grey relational grade than the rotary turning process that implies outperformance of the vibratory-rotary turning with respect to the rotary turning process. The obtained results were then verified, compared, and discussed based on the mechanics of turning process.

AB In most of existing multiobjective estimation of distribution algorithms (MEDAs), there exist drawbacks: incorrect treatment of population outliers; the loss of population diversity; and too much computational effort being spent on finding an optimal population model. To ease the drawbacks, this paper designs a novel clustering-based multivariate Gaussian sampling strategy and proposes an adaptive MEDA called AMEDA. A clustering analysis approach is utilized in AMEDA to discover the distribution structure of the population. Based on the distribution information, with a certain probability, a local or a global multivariate Gaussian model (MGM) is built for each solution to sample a new solution. A covariance sharing strategy is designed in AMEDA to reduce the complexity of building MGMs, and an adaptive update strategy of the probability that controls the contributions of the two types of MGMs is developed to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation. AMEDA is compared with four representative MOEAs on a number of test instances with complex Pareto fronts and variable linkages. Experimental results suggest that AMEDA outperforms the comparison algorithms on dealing with the test instances. The effectiveness of the clustering-based multivariate Gaussian sampling strategy and the adaptive probability update strategy is also experimentally verified.

AB Due to the fact that a nonlinear equation system (NES) may contain multiple optimal solutions, solving NESs is one of the most important challenges in numerical computation. When applying evolutionary algorithms to solve NESs, two issues should be considered: 1) how to transform an NES into a kind of optimization problem and 2) how to develop an optimization algorithm to solve the transformed optimization problem. In this paper, we tackle the first issue by transforming an NES into a weighted biobjective optimization problem. By the above transformation, not only do all the optimal solutions of an original NES become the Pareto optimal solutions of the transformed biobjective optimization problem, but also their images are different points on a linear Pareto front in the objective space. In addition, we suggest an adaptive multiobjective differential evolution, the goal of which is to effectively locate the Pareto optimal solutions of the transformed biobjective optimization problem. Once these solutions are found, the optimal solutions of the original NES can also be obtained correspondingly. By combining the weighted biobjective transformation technique with the adaptive multiobjective differential evolution, we propose a generic framework for the simultaneous locating of multiple optimal solutions of NESs. Comprehensive experiments on 38 NESs with various features have demonstrated that our framework provides very competitive overall performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

AB Decomposition is an efficient and prevailing strategy for solving multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). Its success has been witnessed by the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm MOEA/D and its variants. In decomposition-based methods, an MOP is decomposed into a number of scalar subproblems by using various scalarizing functions. Most decomposition schemes adopt the weighting method to construct scalarizing functions. In this paper, another classical generation method in the field of mathematical programming, that is the epsilon-constraint method, is adopted for the multiobjective optimization. It selects one of the objectives as the main objective and converts other objectives into constraints. We incorporate the epsilon-constraint method into the decomposition strategy and propose a new decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm with the epsilon-constraint framework (DMOEA-epsilon C). It decomposes an MOP into a series of scalar constrained optimization subproblems by assigning each subproblem with an upper bound vector. These subproblems are optimized simultaneously by using information from neighboring subproblems. Besides, a main objective alternation strategy, a solution-to-subproblem matching procedure, and a subproblem-to-solution matching procedure are proposed to strike a balance between convergence and diversity. DMOEA-epsilon C is compared with a number of state-of-theart multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. Experimental studies demonstrate that DMOEA-epsilon C outperforms or performs competitively against these algorithms on the majority of 34 continuous benchmark problems, and it also shows obvious advantages in solving multiobjective 0-1 knapsack problems.

AB To enhance the search performance of evolutionary algorithms, reusing knowledge captured from past optimization experiences along the search process has been proposed in the literature, and demonstrated much promise. In the literature, there are generally three types of approaches for reusing knowledge from past search experiences, namely exact storage and reuse of past solutions, the reuse of model-based information, and the reuse of structured knowledge captured from past optimized solutions. In this paper, we focus on the third type of knowledge reuse for enhancing evolutionary search. In contrast to existing works, here we focus on knowledge transfer across heterogeneous continuous optimization problems with diverse properties, such as problem dimension, number of objectives, etc., that cannot be handled by existing approaches. In particular, we propose a novel autoencoding evolutionary search paradigm with learning capability across heterogeneous problems. The essential ingredient for learning structured knowledge from search experience in our proposed paradigm is a single layer denoising autoencoder (DA), which is able to build the connections between problem domains by treating past optimized solutions as the corrupted version of the solutions for the newly encountered problem. Further, as the derived DA holds a closed-form solution, the corresponding reusing of knowledge from past search experiences will not bring much additional computational burden on the evolutionary search. To evaluate the proposed search paradigm, comprehensive empirical studies on the complex multiobjective optimization problems are presented, along with a real-world case study from the fiber-reinforced polymer composites manufacturing industry.

AB Multiple problems in bioinformatics research involve the optimization of time-consuming objective functions over exponentially growing search spaces. The capabilities shown by modern parallel systems composed of clusteredmulticoremultiprocessors represent an opportunity to address such difficult problems. A suitable paradigm to exploit these systems lies on the combination of mixed mode programming and evolutionary computation. This research focuses on the reconstruction of multiobjective phylogenetic hypotheses by using an indicator-based evolutionary algorithm. In order to overcome the main sources of complexity of the problem, we propose a parallel adaptation of this algorithm based on master-worker principles. Experimental results on six real data sets report that the design achieves an efficient exploitation of a shared-distributed memory hybrid system composed of 48 processing cores, observing improved scalability in comparison with other parallel proposals. In addition, the inferred Pareto fronts give account of the relevance of the indicator-based design, verifying significant solution quality under different multiobjective metrics and biological testing procedures.

AB In this paper, multiobjective transformer design (TD) optimization is carried out using multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) based on decomposition with dynamical resource allocation (MOEA/D-DRA) for four sets of conflicting TD bi-objectives such as (i) purchase cost and total loss, (ii) purchase cost and total lifetime cost (TLTC), (iii) total mass and total loss and (iv) total mass and TLTC, subjected to 14 various practical constraints. Significant decision variables with enlarged search space are employed for obtaining reliable and efficient TD with minimum losses and TLTC. TD is accompanied by 3D-finite element method assessment to validate the designed no-load loss calculated from analytical equations. To improve the searching ability of MOEA/D-DRA (MDRA) in solving this complex multimodal TD optimization problem (TDOP), this paper proposes integration of chaos with MDRA, enabling chaotic variation in the crossover rate and mutation scaling factor. To prove the effectiveness of chaos-assisted MOEA, logistic chaotic map-assisted MDRA, and iterative chaotic map with infinite collapses-(ICMIC) assisted MDRA(ICMDRA) have been successfully applied to multiobjective TDOP and their TD results are compared with those of MDRA, knee point-driven evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm (KnEA), and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) II. This paper identifies which chaotic map can assist MDRA and solve TDOP by comparative analysis of performance of logistic and ICMIC chaotic maps. Efficient TD results and two MOEA performance indicators confirm the superiority of ICMDRA over all the other MOEAs in terms of diversity and convergence in solving TDOP.

AB Thermal efficiency and emission of a gas-turbine cycle were improved through consideration of heat and mass recirculations. In this regard, three potential scenarios were investigated: using lone mass circulation, only heat recirculation, and both types of recirculation at the same time. In each scenario, the maximum potential improvement was found by multi-objective optimization. Furthermore, in the case of only heat circulation scenario, the best heat recirculator was chosen by comparing a tubular with a plate-fin heat exchanger (PFHE) a well-known decision-making method which is called analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Finally, AHP method was employed again to select the superior scenario for improving the gas cycle. According to the results, the best scenario was the scenario in which heat recirculation with PFHE was used in the absence of mass recirculation. In this scenario, thermal efficiency and NOx emission were improved 4.20 and 17.94%, respectively. The payback time of the investment of the modification was also about 62 days. Moreover, due to the shortage of power in the case of mass recirculation, this scenario was found to be desirable when there is extra capacity in power generation, and the goal is reducing emissions as much as possible.

AB Multi-objective programming is used to analyze the performance of different organic Rankine cycle (ORC) plant layouts with different working fluids for low temperature binary-cycle geothermal plant. The studied results show that for the considered ORC plant layouts, the optimal overall performance indices increase with the geothermal temperature increasing. For a specific working fluid, the optimal ORC system for overall performance always remains unchanged despite the increase in the geothermal temperature. The optimal schemes of ORC systems vary with the performance indices of ORC system. The optimal scheme for comprehensive performance index is simple cycle with R123 when the geothermal temperature increases from 80 degrees C to 95 degrees C. The optimal scheme for thermal efficiency is regenerative cycle with R123, while the optimal scheme for capital cost is superheated cycle with R123. For the work output and exergy efficiency, the optimal scheme is superheated cycle with R152a when the geothermal temperature varies from 80 degrees C to 85 degrees C, while the scheme of superheated cycle with R134a is better for work output and exergy efficiency when the geothermal temperature is greater than 90 degrees C. This study provides useful references for the researchers selecting the optimal configuration of ORC system for low temperature binary-cycle geothermal plant. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A 144 MW combined cycle power plant (CCPP) based on simple and regenerative gas turbine units working on natural gas is investigated. By establishing mathematical model to simulate the power plants, thermo-environmental and economic analysis are conducted. The effects of five key parameters including compressor inlet temperature, compressor pressure ratio, gas turbine inlet temperature, pinch point temperature difference and main steam pressure are investigated on net power output, energy and exergy efficiencies, CO2 emissions, exergy destruction/loss and levelized cost. The multiple regression models are developed to determine the correlation amongst these variables. Moreover, a multi-dimensional optimization using Nelder-Mead method is carried out to find optimal operating parameters for maximum efficiency and minimum levelized cost. Results show significant impacts of gas turbine inlet temperature and compressor pressure ratio on the performance and costs. The optimum energy efficiency of simple and regenerative CCPP are in the range of 36.2-56.6% and 35-58.2%, respectively under varying operating parameters while the optimal levelized costs US$ 0.0398 and 0.037 per kWh, respectively are estimated. The combustion chamber and HRSG are the major contributors towards exergy destruction amongst all components, followed by exergy loss due to stack. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   APPLICATION
AB Management of biosolids from industrial and municipal wastewater facilities presents multifaceted issues ranging from greenhouse gas emissions, high odor and high treatment costs. Until now, most studies that have focused on identifying the best treatment pathway are based on optimization of technological alternatives and life cycle analysis studies. Such studies aim toward sustainability but ignore the capacity of local ecological systems to provide ecosystem services, thus leading to design solutions that may be sub-optimal due to shifting of impacts outside the boundary, resulting in degradation. This work uses a techno-ecological synergy design methodology to identify optimal strategies for biosolids treatment and disposal, by balancing the supply and demand for carbon sequestration ecosystem service. Both the technological systems that create the ecosystem service demand and ecological systems that supply those services are included within one design framework. Technological alternatives for biosolids management in Central Ohio considered in this work are land filling, land application, incineration and composting. Approaches for supplying the carbon sequestration capacity include forestation, extension of timber cycles and geological sequestration. An additional case where biomass utilization from extension of timber cycle to produce renewable energy is also explored. Results from this study demonstrate that including carbon sequestration ecosystem service explicitly in the design problem leads to solutions where the ecosystem service demand and supply can be balanced, while also being cost-effective. Thus by including ecological systems in the design boundary, the optimal solution space expands to reveal novel solutions that cannot be found by the conventional techno-centric approach.

AB This paper treats a control technique designed to maximise the working of a rotary permanent magnet magnetic refrigerator (RPMMR). The method, named ANNTEO, is based on the use of the artificial neural networks (ANNs), which have demonstrated to predict well the energy performances of an actual RPMMR obtaining a good agreement with the experimental tests. The ANN gives the possibility to carry out a working map, and then, applying an optimisation process, it is possible to catch the optimal working point regarding the number of revolution of the magnets per minute and the volumetric flow rate of the regenerating fluid. In particular, the optimisation can be processed with the aim to maximise the COP (energy saving) or the cooling capacity (time-saving). As a proof of the concept, this paper reports an example of an application of the ANNTEO. Also, new perspectives on the use of the ANNs in the magnetic refrigeration field are proposed.

AB A cooling tower is an imperative component of industrial plants. The minimization of energy related expenses is critical for conservation of resources and energy savings. Hence, the present study explores the use of an improved Jaya algorithm called self-adaptive Jaya algorithm for optimal design of cooling tower from economic facets. In this work, six different examples are considered in the design optimization of mechanical draft cooling tower. Various researchers have attempted the same mathematical models by using different methods like Merkel method, Poppe method and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. The results achieved by using the proposed self-adaptive Jaya algorithm are compared with the results achieved by using the Merkel method, Poppe method, ABC algorithm and basic Jaya algorithm. The proposed self-adaptive Jaya algorithm determines the population size automatically and the user need not tune the population size. The proposed self-adaptive Jaya algorithm is proved better as compared to the other optimization methods with respect to achieving the optimal value of the objective function at less computational effort.

AB The paper considers the problem of optimization of the box section of the main girder of the single-girder bridge crane. Reduction of the girder mass is set as the objective function. The constraint functions are the criteria of strength, local stability of plates, lateral stability of the girder, stiffness, dynamic stiffness, as well the constraints of cost effective design. Methods of the following biologically inspired algorithms were used for the optimization: Firefly Algorithm (FA), Bat Algorithm (BA) and Cuckoo Search algorithm (CS). The obtained results of optimization were compared with several solutions of single-girder bridge cranes, which verified the optimization method. The paper presents the advantages and weaknesses of the methods applied to the concrete solutions of single-girder bridge cranes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The satisfaction of client needs is the goal of most of the industrial systems, which can be achieved by appropriate life-cycle management. When it concerns complex real-world systems, the difficulty of managing their life-cycle increases with increasing of the links and interactions between the system components and between the system and its environment. Therefore, the need of addressing a complete and realistic maintenance planning approach to face these difficulties is crucial. This article presents a methodology for maintenance optimization of complex systems using Bayesian networks. In this methodology, the objective function, which aims at maximizing the system benefit, allows conciliating between two contradictory objectives: reducing the maintenance costs and reaching an availability target fixed according to the customer demand. The Bayesian networks are used to take into account the system interactions, while the maintenance policy, which is based on the imperfect preventive maintenance and considers several efficiency levels, is used to build a realistic maintenance planning model. An application to a water supply system is included to illustrate the benefit and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Production scheduling and maintenance planning are two interdependent issues that most often have been investigated independently. Although both preventive maintenance (PM) and minimal repair affect availability and failure rate of a machine, only a few researchers have considered this interdependency in the literature. Furthermore, most of the existing joint production and preventive maintenance scheduling methods assume that machine is available during the planning horizon and consider only a possible level for PM. In this research, an integrated model is proposed that coordinates preventive maintenance planning with single-machine scheduling to minimize the weighted completion time of jobs and maintenance cost, simultaneously. This paper not only considers multiple PM levels with different costs, times and reductions in the hazard rate of the machine, but also assumes that a machine failure may occur at any time. To illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested method, it is compared to two situations of no PM and a single PM level. Eventually, to tackle the suggested problem, multi-objective particle swarm optimization and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) are employed and their parameters are tuned Furthermore, their performances are compared in terms of three metrics criteria.

AB In many real-world optimization problems, a solution cannot be realized in practice exactly as computed, e.g., it may be impossible to produce a board of exactly 3.546 mm width. Whenever computed solutions are not realized exactly but in a perturbed way, we speak of decision uncertainty. We study decision uncertainty in multiobjective optimization problems and we propose the concept of decision robust efficiency for evaluating the robustness of a solution in this case. This solution concept is defined by using the framework of set-valued maps. We prove that convexity and continuity are preserved by the resulting set-valued maps. Moreover, we obtain specific results for particular classes of objective functions that are relevant for solving the set-valued problem. We furthermore prove that decision robust efficient solutions can be found by solving a deterministic problem in case of linear objective functions. We also investigate the relationship of the proposed concept to other concepts in the literature.

AB Having successfully handled many-objective optimization problems with box constraints only by using VaEA, a vector angle based many-objective evolutionary algorithm in our precursor study, this paper extended VaEA to solve generic constrained many-objective optimization problems. The proposed algorithm (denoted by CVaEA) differs from the original one mainly in the mating selection and the environmental selection, which are made suitable in the presence of infeasible solutions. Furthermore, we suggest a set of new constrained many-objective test problems which have different ranges of function values for all the objectives. Compared with normalized problems, this set of scaled ones is more applicable to test an algorithm's performance. This is due to the nature property of practical problems being usually far from normalization. The proposed CVaEA was compared with two latest constrained many-objective optimization methods on the proposed test problems with up to 15 objectives, and on a constrained engineering problem from practice. It was shown by the simulation results that CVaEA could find a set of well converged and properly distributed solutions, and, compared with its competitors, obtained a better balance between convergence and diversity. This, and the original VaEA paper, together demonstrate the usefulness and efficiency of vector angle based algorithms for handling both constrained and unconstrained many-objective optimization problems.

AB In this study, the integration of different desalination systems into cogeneration systems has been examined. Based on the operating conditions of the cogeneration system, this integration can result in either the improvement or impairment of the cogeneration efficiency. The R-curve is a powerful tool to investigate the effect of this integration on the cogeneration system performance. Several scenarios for integration of RO and MED systems at different operating points are investigated. Some case studies are examined using the presented concept to verify the proposed methodology. There is a significant variation in the economics of the systems in the presented integration scenarios. The R-curve has been utilized for the integration of MED and RO desalination technologies with cogeneration systems to identify effective ways to decrease the operating cost. As an illustration, based on the operating conditions, the integration of a 24 MW RO desalination plant can either provide a 12.123 MW fuel saving or cause 23.502 MW excess fuel consumption due to different cogeneration performances in the same cogeneration system (case study 1). Also, the integration of 17.8 MW(t) MED unit can either cause 47.835 MW excess fuel consumption or provide 28.974 MW fuel saving (case study 2).

AB This paper focuses on the performance of shape-memory-alloy rubber bearings (SMARBs) compared to conventional lead-plug or New-Zealand (N-Z) bearings in control of building vibration due to underground blast induced ground motion (BIGM). The performance is evaluated with regard to maximum acceleration and isolator displacement obtained by nonlinear time history analysis. In doing so the Bouc-Wen's model is used to represent the nonlinear behaviour of the N-Z bearing and the superelastic behaviour of nickel-titanium-based shape-memory alloy is represented by the Graesser-Cozzarelli model. The underground BIGM input is modelled by exponentially decaying function. It is observed that though the N-Z bearing is fairly effective in controlling the structural accelerations due to BIGM without excessive bearing displacements, there remains a problem with the residual bearing displacements. The latter, however, is found to be dealt with very effectively by the SMARB. Furthermore, the procedure to obtain the optimum design parameters of the base isolators under study is obtained by optimizing two mutually conflicting objective functions, that is, the minimization of peak acceleration as well as peak bearing displacement by converting the multiobjective optimization problem to a single composite objective function. The improved and robust control performance of SMARB compared to N-Z bearing is elucidated through numerical study by considering a five-storied shear building frame.

AB No-moving-part (NMP) valves, such as Tesla valves, are engineered fluid channels whose flow resistance depends on the flow direction. They have no moving parts and do not deform, but rely on inertial forces of the fluid to preferentially allow flow in one direction while strongly inhibiting flow in the reverse direction. NMP valves have significant advantages over active valves in terms of their reliability and easy manufacturability. Several previous studies have explored optimum designs of NMP valves, and the most widely used indicator of NMP valve performance is diodicity, defined as the ratio of the pressure drop of reverse flow to that of the forward flow. However, higher diodicity does not necessarily imply a lower pressure drop for the forward flow, and if this pressure drop is too high, significant pumping power is required, which makes the NMP valve inefficient for use in pumping applications. Therefore, for the design NMP valves, treating the forward and reverse flow pressure drops independently in a multiobjective formulation is preferable to optimization of the diodicity alone. In this paper, we propose a bi-objective topology optimization method for an optimum design of an NMP valve. One objective function is to minimize the pressure drop in the forward flow, and the other is to maximize the pressure drop in the reverse flow. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB We study the generic problem of path optimization for a critical infrastructure link between two locations on the surface of the Earth in the vicinity of earthquake-prone areas. The problem has two (conflicting) objective functions, one for minimizing the construction cost of the link and the other for minimizing the number of potential repairs along the link in the wake of earthquakes. In our model, the Earth's surface is approximated by a triangulated manifold, and ground motion intensity data are used to provide a measure of repair rate. We approach the multiobjective variational problem by first converting it into a single objective variational problem using the weighted sum method. Then, we show that the problem can be further transformed into an Eikonal equation and solved by a computationally efficient algorithm based on the fast marching method. Extensive simulations are performed on real-world three-dimensional geographical data, from which we obtain Pareto optimal solutions that provide insight and guidance to design trade-offs between cost effectiveness and seismic resilience.

AB The development and the utilization of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) are outmost importance targets of European strategic plans in the context of sustainable development. Greece sustains a plentiful abundance of RES, which should be proven advantageous towards a gradual independence from the fossil fuels based on an ongoing exploitation of all RES, accordingly. This study aims at developing a typology of the regional units (NUTS III) of Greece based on the number and respective installed power of RES plants for the production of electricity.
   The clustering of the Greek regional units (former prefectures) is accomplished by using the multivariate statistical method of cluster analysis and, more specifically, through hierarchical cluster analysis. The hierarchical cluster analysis resulted in five clusters, each featuring different characteristics. The first cluster consists of nineteen regional units located in mainland Greece. The majority of electricity generating plants from RES are found in this cluster. The second cluster comprises eighteen regional units, most of which are located on islands. This cluster includes a large number of wind plants, of low power however. The third cluster consists of six regional units and is characterized by a large number of high power wind plants. The fourth cluster includes seven regional units, which are all located in mainland Greece. A characteristic feature of this cluster is the fact that it includes most biomass plants, and the majority of small hydropower plants. The fifth cluster only comprises one regional unit, Attiki, where the capital of Greece is located.

AB This paper proposes a new methodology based on the use of Resonance Index (RI) analysis as a posteriori decision-making procedure to check solutions of the optimization algorithm NSGA-II against resonance, when applied to the capacitor banks placement problem in radial distribution systems. Most of existing methodologies approach harmonic resonance in the referred problem through the inclusion of constraints in the optimization procedure with respect to the harmonic distortion indexes THD and IHD. However, monitoring only these two parameters is not sufficient to identify specific problems on capacitor banks due to harmonic resonance. To demonstrate this point, a RI analysis using the resonant chart was performed considering a 34-bus radial system. Also, the proposed a posteriori analysis is compared with the one that includes directly RI as a constraint in the optimization procedure, demonstrating that the proposed approach has a better performance with respect to computational time.

AB The supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle (SCO2-BC) is proposed to be used as the concept of fast cooled reactor (FCR), which is a typical application in the 4th generation reactors. The recuperator and cooler, which acted as important components in SCO2-BC, are required for long-term operation especially at the high pressure condition. However, the traditional shell-and-tube heat exchanger, which already has mature fabrication technology, is not appropriate in the developing miniaturized thermal system because of its low compactness. In the present paper, the compact printed circuit heat exchanger (PCHE) with straight ribs is manufactured by the photochemical etching technology and the diffusion bonding method independently. Then, the thermohydraulic performance of PCHE is tested on the SCO2-water experiment platform. Considering the difference of thermal properties of working fluid, the comparison of thermal and hydraulic performance between SCO2 and water in the tested PCHE is studied at the same mass flow rate, which shows that the SCO2 has better heat transfer capability than water fluid. Further, the heat transfer rate and pressure loss of PCHE are investigated at different SCO2 operating pressure, which indicates that the PCHE has better comprehensive performance when it operates at higher pressure condition. Meanwhile, the extreme operating condition due to the pseudo-critical point of CO2 working in the PCHE is analyzed comparing with the normal operating condition. The results show that the comprehensive performance of PCHE is significantly reduced nearly 17.6% when operates at the transcritical state. The heat transfer correlation of PCHE with straight ribs is fitted by experimental data in both the supercritical and transcritical states in order to simplifying design process.

AB In this paper, a general model for multi-state deteriorating systems with condition based preventive maintenance is introduced and analyzed extensively. The system experiences various levels of deterioration and at each stage, an inspection is carried out at constant time intervals in order to identify what kind of preventive maintenance, the system should undergo. When the system fails, despite preventive maintenance, a repair procedure is carried out and the system is restored to its initial fully operational state. The proposed model incorporates also imperfect maintenance, either minimal or major, failed maintenance and sudden failures that may occur mostly due to external factors at any deterioration state as well. Moreover, the sojourn times are assumed to be generally distributed. The main dependability and performance measures of the proposed model are computed while the corresponding transient measures are estimated using Monte Carlo simulation. Our endmost aim is to distinguish inspection and consequently maintenance policies that optimize multi-state deteriorating system's dependability and/or performance. Additionally, multi-objective optimization problems are formulated and solve in order to distinguish preventive maintenance policies that optimize simultaneously both the dependability and performance measures.

AB The design of mechanical structures is a task which requires a large amount of experience. Experience can only be gained with time and this represents a disadvantage for junior engineers. However, using optimization methods, inexperienced engineers can achieve optimal results. One application for optimization methods in engineering is the design of mechanisms. The design problem can be formulated as an optimization problem, and so the optimal solution can be found using optimization, regardless of the experience of the design engineer. The aim of this paper is to present how the design of a parallel structure can be formulated as an optimization problem, how the factors influencing the design are incorporated in the problem formulation as goals or constraints. The developed theoretical aspects are then applied for the optimization of the parallel structure. Since the application of the optimized structure is a haptic device, the goal is to minimize the difference between the workspace of the robot and the defined most used part of the workspace of the human hand. Genetic Algorithms have been chosen to carry out the optimization. Results show that the method has dimensioned the design variables in a manner that corresponds to the formulated goal.

AB The motivation behind this work is to explore a nanoscale irreversible Stirling refrigerator with respect to size impacts and shows two novel thermo-ecological criteria. Two distinct strategies were suggested in the optimization process and the consequences of every strategy were examined independently. In the primary strategy, with the purpose of maximizing the energetic sustainability index and modified the ecological coefficient of performance (MECOP) and minimizing the dimensionless Ecological function, a multi objective optimization algorithm (MOEA) was used. In the second strategy, with the purpose of maximizing the ECOP and MECOP and minimizing the dimensionless Ecological function, a MOEA was used. To conclude the final solution from each strategy, three proficient decision makers were utilized. Additionally, to quantify the deviation of the results gained from each decision makers, two different statistical error indexes were employed. Finally, based on the comparison between the results achieved from proposed scenarios reveals that by maximizing the MECOP the maximum values of ESI, ECOP, and a minimum of ecf are achieved.

AB This work is an attempt to select the optimum process parameters for friction stir welding of aluminium 2024 alloy based on multiple criteria decision making approach. The friction stir welding experiments have been conducted according to L9 orthogonal array with preferred input parameters are tool rotational speed, welding speed and tool offset. The response parameters measured are ultimate tensile strength, impact toughness and hardness of welded joint that determines quality of joint. The multi criteria decision making techniques namely Grey Relational Analysis and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution are used to find the optimum process parameter which provides maximum value of all responses. Same result is obtained through both techniques and the optimum conditions are tool rotational speed of 1000 rpm, welding speed of 80 mm/min and tool offset at 0 mm. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB An efficient frontier in the typical portfolio selection problem provides an illustrative way to express the tradeoffs between return and risk. Following the basic ideas of modern portfolio theory as introduced by Markowitz, security returns are usually extracted from past data. Our purpose in this paper is to incorporate future returns scenarios in the investment decision process. For representative points on the efficient frontier, the minimax regret portfolio is calculated, on the basis of the aforementioned scenarios. These points correspond to specific weight combinations. In this way, the areas of the efficient frontier that are more robust than others are identified. The underlying key-contribution is related to the extension of the conventional minimax regret criterion formulation, in multiobjective programming problems. The validity of the approach is verified through an illustrative empirical testing application on the Eurostoxx 50. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The rising electricity demand of data centers has initiated a development trend toward highly efficient power supplies. Therefore, a multicell converter approach for a telecom rectifier module breaking through the efficiency and power density barriers of traditional single-cell converter systems is presented in this paper. The potential of the multicell approach for high efficiency is derived from fundamental scaling laws of different system performance aspects in dependence of the number of converter cells and the benefits of the interleaving technique. Based on the available degrees of freedom in the design of such a converter system, a comprehensive multiobjective optimization of the entire system with respect to efficiency and power density is performed with detailed component loss and volume models. In order to verify the analytical models and the design procedure, a hardware demonstrator of a 3.3 kW multicell 230 V-AC/48 V-DC telecom power supply with N-cells = 6 isolated converter cells in an input-series output-parallel arrangement is presented with measurement results indicating a maximum efficiency of eta = 97.7% and a power density of rho = 2.2 kW/dm(3) (= 36 W/in(3)). Furthermore, different paths for future performance improvements of the multicell arrangement are outlined.

AB In cooperative multi-relay networks, the relay nodes which are selected are very important to the system performance. How to choose the best cooperative relay nodes is an optimization problem. In this paper, multi-relay selection schemes which consider either single objective or multi-objective are proposed based on evolutionary algorithms. Firstly, the single objective optimization problems of multi-relay selection considering signal to noise ratio (SNR) or power efficiency maximization are solved based on the quantum bee colony optimization (QBCO). Then the multi-objective optimization problems of multi-relay selection considering SNR maximization and power consumption minimization (two contradictive objectives) or SNR maximization and power efficiency maximization (also two contradictive objectives) are solved based on non-dominated sorting quantum bee colony optimization (NSQBCO), which can obtain the Pareto front solutions considering two contradictive objectives simultaneously. Simulation results show that QBCO based multi-relay selection schemes have the ability to search global optimal solution compared with other multi-relay selection schemes in literature, while NSQBCO based multi-relay selection schemes can obtain the same Pareto front solutions as exhaustive search when the number of relays is not very large. When the number of relays is very large, exhaustive search cannot be used due to complexity but NSQBCO based multi-relay selection schemes can still be used to solve the problems. All simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

AB Hydrogen has an instrumental role to play in shaping the future of the UK's transport system. Huge reductions in 'Greenhouse Gas' (GHG) emissions may be achievable whilst providing a secure source of clean and sustainable fuel. Hydrogen transition has already begun but to strengthen and power the 'hydrogen economy' momentum in the UK, the development of the hydrogen infrastructure needs to make progress more quickly. There are many challenges associated with this due to the complexity at each node of Hydrogen Supply Chains (HSC), such as the number of processes to produce hydrogen. This raises the challenge to model HSCs, allowing analysis of various pathways and optimal configurations. This report aims firstly, to review the factors discussed in the literature on HSC and identify gaps or issues that require further debate with regards to introducing hydrogen in the transport system. Secondly, various HSC modelling techniques have been categorised according to mathematical methods used and the factors being considered. Studies in the literature have analysed hydrogen transport systems in terms of capital and operating costs of the infrastructure, and the cost of hydrogen, environmental implications and risk. A significant market share can be obtained by hydrogen in the near future with the minimisation of cost across the supply chain from production to end-use. Effective policies are required to speed up the process and increase the energy efficiency alongside mitigating GHGs and improving fuel security. Further developments in the mathematical optimisation models and technical breakthrough will enable the transition to a hydrogen economy take place with minimum disruption and issues.

AB In this study, a dynamic and two-dimensional model for a steam methane reforming process integrated with nuclear heat production is developed. The model is based on first principles and considers the conservation of mass, momentum and energy within the system. The model is multi-scale, considering both bulk gas effects as well as spatial differences within the catalyst particles. Very few model parameters need to be fit based on the design specifications reported in the literature. The resulting model fits the reported design conditions of two separate pilot-scale studies (ranging from 0.4 to 10 MW heat transfer duty). A sensitivity analysis indicated that disturbances in the helium feed conditions significantly affect the system, but the overall system performance only changes slightly even for the large changes in the value of the most uncertain parameters.

AB A decision support tool has been developed that uses global multiobjective optimization based on 1)the environmental impacts, evaluated within the framework of full life cycle assessment; and 2)process costs, evaluated by using rigorous process models. This approach is particularly useful in developing biorenewable-based energy solutions and chemicals manufacturing, for which multiple criteria must be evaluated and optimization-based decision-making processes are particularly attractive. The framework is demonstrated by using a case study of the conversion of terpenes derived from biowaste feedstocks into reactive intermediates. A two-step chemical conversion/separation sequence was implemented as a rigorous process model and combined with a life cycle model. A life cycle inventory for crude sulfate turpentine was developed, as well as a conceptual process of its separation into pure terpene feedstocks. The performed single- and multiobjective optimizations demonstrate the functionality of the optimization-based process development and illustrate the approach. The most significant advance is the ability to perform multiobjective global optimization, resulting in identification of a region of Pareto-optimal solutions.

AB We have developed a new approach in order to compute the optimal way of filling as efficiently as possible an hydrogen reservoir using activated carbon as the storing material. Our approach combines finite element computation with multi objective optimization techniques based on the Fast Pareto Genetic Algorithm (FPGA) to find an ensemble of optimal solutions known as the Pareto front. We have illustrated our method by studying a small cylindrical reservoir. We were able to find a 7-point filling function (i.e. the input flow as a function of time) giving the shortest filling time to reach a stored hydrogen mass for a given heat transfer coefficient while keeping the reservoir internal temperature and pressure under their maximal safe values.

AB Process plans and cutting parameters are important components in the computer aided process planning. Reasonable choice of process plans and cutting parameters can significant affect the energy consumption as well as traditional economic performances of manufacturing systems. Traditionally, process planning and cutting parameter optimization were carried out separately and sequentially at a machine tool level or a machining process level, which limits the potential for energy savings. Considering the fact that the functions of two components in different operation levels are usually complementary, the energy consumption of CNC machining system can be further improved if they are tightly integrated. In this paper, an integrated approach of process planning and cutting parameter optimization is proposed to minimize the total energy consumption of CNC machining and to balance machine workloads in workshop. Firstly, the energy characteristics of machining process are explicitly analyzed by considering multiple process flexibilities and the cutting parameters. Then a multi-objective integration model of process planning and cutting parameter optimization is proposed to take the minimum energy consumption and balance of machine workloads as the optimization objectives, which is solved by a Multi objective Simulated Annealing algorithm. To verify the energy-saving performance of the proposed multi-objective integration problem, case studies have been conducted and the experimental results show that: i) the energy-oriented integration problem can achieve more energy savings compared with energy-oriented process planning or energy-oriented cutting parameter optimization; ii) the energy oriented integration of process planning and cutting parameter optimization does not always yield a solution that addresses the need for balance of machine workloads; iii) The proposed multi-objective integration method can strike a balance between the total energy consumption and the machine workload.

AB In recent years, environmental impacts of energy consumption in different production systems have become more adverse. Agricultural systems, as results of food security and production growth, are nowadays significant energy consumers. Owing to various reasons, energy consumption in these systems, especially those in developing countries, are often inefficient. As such, there are three objectives in this study. The first objective is the assessment of energy flow, cumulative exergy demand and life cycle of paddy fields. The second goal is the optimization of energy consumption by employing Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) for enhancement of energy efficiency (reduction in energy consumption and increase performance in paddy production) and reduction of adverse environmental effects in paddy production. The third objective is the provision of the optimum pattern of energy consumption in paddy production in Guilan Province of Iran. Optimization results indicate that energy savings by employing DEA and MOGA are 21.15% and 71.63%, respectively. They indicate that the enhancement of the efficiency of paddy production is mainly in terms of toxins and chemical fertilizers. Besides, all adverse environmental impacts by MOGA are significantly less than from its counterparts by DEA and present farms. The most significant difference between MOGA and DEA is associated to ozone layer depletion. As a result, MOGA can be introduced as an adequate optimization method to determine the best mix of paddy production inputs, minimizing adverse environmental impact and maximizing performances of farms and energy efficiency simultaneously. This study highlights the utilization and the performance of MOGA in paddy production systems to determine the optimized composition for mixing energy, yield and environmental impacts. The implementation of the recommended consumption patterns will be able to attain sustainable development in paddy production in Guilan province of Iran, owing to the protection of non-renewable resources, the reduction of adverse environmental effects and the improvement of economic conditions for rice farmers.

AB A technical solution recycling exhaust gas sensible heat based on thermoelectric power generation is proposed by using finite time thermodynamics. The effects of some key parameters such as exhaust gas inlet temperature, exhaust gas and cooling water heat transfer coefficient on the optimum length of the thermoelectric elements are analyzed. It is found that the gas temperature drops rapidly because of the small specific heat of the exhaust gas. Enhancing the heat transfer of gas can effectively improve the power, but not the efficiency. Exhaust gas inlet temperature and transfer coefficient have significant effects on the optimal thermoelectric element length. Due to the highest hot surface operating temperature limit 200 degrees C, the optimal length of the thermoelectric elements is about 2 mm. About 1.47 kW electrical energy can be produced per square meter and the conversion efficiency of 4.5% can be achieved for exhaust gas at 350 degrees C. The payback period of the waste heat recovery device is about 4 years for the price and performance of thermoelectric products made in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, an inexact two-stage stochastic fuzzy programming (ITSFP) is developed for regional power generation planning with considering the intermittency and fuzziness of renewable energy power output. ITSFP incorporates interval-parameter programming (IPP), two-stage stochastic programming (TSP), and fuzzy credibility constrained programming (FCCP) within a general optimization framework which can tackle uncertainties expressed as intervals, probability distributions, and fuzzy sets. The developed method is applied to a regional electric power system over a one-day optimization horizon coupled with air pollution control. The power generation schemes, imported electricity, and system cost under various environmental goals and risk preferences are analyzed. The obtained results indicate that the model can provide a linkage between predefined electric power generation schedule and the relevant economic implications, as well as more reasonable decision alternatives for decision makers by loosening system constraints at specified confidence level. Besides, the fuzziness of forecast error corresponding to the variability of renewable energy resources could be effectively reflected. Moreover, the results are useful for addressing the trade-off between system economy and system risk. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) in distribution networks has brought great challenges to the volt/var management due to their intermittency and volatility. This paper proposes a two stage energy management framework of distribution networks to facilitate the accommodation of high wind energy penetration. In the proposed framework, the volt/var management problem is formulated and decomposed as a two-stage energy scheduling optimization model with different time frames considering the uncertainties of wind energy and load forecasts. In the first stage, a scenario-based stochastic day-ahead scheduling model is formulated to optimize the 24-h charging/discharging scheme of energy storage system (ESS) and power generation of diesel generator (DG) in order to minimize the expected operation cost. Based on the stochastic optimal scheduling results in the first stage, the second stage implements the multiobjective volt/var optimization (VVO) to determine the optimal real-time operation of volt/var control devices, considering the costs of adjusting the control devices (CACDs). The proposed method has been fully evaluated and benchmarked on a 69-bus distribution network under various operational scenarios to demonstrate its superiority on various performance metrics and further confirm its effectiveness and efficiency for distribution networks to accommodate a high penetration of wind energy.

AB An irreversible hybrid solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)-Brayton heat engine system is taken into account in this study. Ecological based thermoenvironmental function is considered to assess the performance of the system as well as the power, exergy destruction, energy and exergy efficiencies. This function enables someone to determine environmental impact of any thermal cycle. Optimum operating conditions for all investigated parameters are obtained. Results are presented numerically and discussed. Some important results are; maximum power density of the hybrid system is 15260.9 (W m(-2)) at i = 17,000 (A m(-2)), maximum energy efficiency of the hybrid system is 0.841 at i = 7200 (A m(-2)), exergy efficiency of the hybrid system is 0.676 at i = 5200 (A m(-2)) and ecological based thermoenvironmental function density of the hybrid system reaches maximum value at i = 5800 (A m(-2)) and it is equal to 0.00603 (W m pts(-1) m(2)). Finally, environmental friendly and efficient operation conditions, i(f) <= i <= i(p), is suggested for the hybrid system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   ANALYSIS
AB In this paper, a combined cooling, heating and power cycle is proposed consisting of three sections of gas turbine and heat recovery steam generator cycle, Regenerative organic Rankine cycle, and absorption refrigeration cycle. This trigeneration cycle is subjected to a thorough thermodynamic and exergoeconomic analysis. The principal goal followed in the investigation is to address the thermodynamic and exergoeconomic of a trigeneration cycle from a new prospective such that the economic and thermodynamic viability of incorporating Regenerative organic Rankine cycle, and absorption refrigeration cycle to the gas turbine and heat recovery steam generator cycle is being investigated. Thus, the cost-effectiveness of the introduced method can be studied and further examined. The results indicate that adding Regenerative organic Rankine cycle to gas turbine and heat recovery steam generator cycle leads to 2.5% increase and the addition of absorption refrigeration cycle to the gas turbine and heat recovery steam generator/ Regenerative Organic Rankine cycle would cause 0.75% increase in the exergetic efficiency of the entire cycle. Furthermore, from total investment cost of the trigeneration cycle, only 5.5% and 0.45% results from Regenerative organic Rankine cycle and absorption refrigeration cycles, respectively.

AB Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is a promising thermal-to-power technology that uses low-temperature heat from various sources including renewable energy and waste heat. A zeotropic fluid ORC offers thermodynamic-performance advantages over pure fluid ORC because of the relatively low irreversibility during the heat transfer process. Nonetheless, zeotropic fluid ORC may incur higher cost than pure fluid ORC because the former has high mass transfer resistance and small temperature difference in the heat exchanger. Limited research has been carried out to enhance thermo-economic performance of zeotropic ORC. In the present study, an ORC that uses zeotropic fluids and undergoes liquid-vapor separation during condensation is proposed. A thermo-economic analysis is developed based on a new optimization model for the proposed ORC. The objective function of the optimization model is the minimization of the specific investment cost. A genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimization model. A case study is then solved to illustrate the advantages of the proposed ORC and validate the proposed thermoeconomic optimization method. The results of the thermodynamic analysis show that the condenser area of the proposed ORC is 17.6% lower than that of the conventional ORC under the same working conditions. Thermo-economic optimization results show that the specific investment cost of the proposed ORC is 13.3-18.4% lower than that of the basic ORC. Meanwhile, the second law efficiency of the proposed ORC is 4.2% higher than that of the conventional ORC. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to assess the dependence of the ORC performance on the temperatures of the heat source and the surrounding environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Life cycle assessment (LCA) based thermoeconomic modelling has been applied for the evaluation of energy conversion systems since it provided more comprehensive and applicable assessment criteria. This study proposes an improved thermoeconomic method, named as life cycle integrated thermoeconomic assessment (LCiTA), which combines the LCA based enviroeconomic parameters in the production steps of the system components and fuel with the conventional thermoeconomic method for the energy conversion systems. A micro-cogeneration system is investigated and analyzed with the LCiTA method, the comparative studies show that the unit cost of fuel by using, the LCiTA method is 3.8 times higher than the conventional thermoeconomic model. It is also realized that the enviroeconomic parameters during the operation of the system components do not have significant impacts on the system streams since the exergetic parameters are dominant in the thermoeconomic calculations. Moreover, the improved sustainability index is found roundly 67.2% higher than the previously defined sustainability index, suggesting that the enviroeconomic and thermoeconomic parameters decrease the impact of the exergy destruction in the sustainability index definition. To find the feasible operation conditions for the micro-cogeneration system, different assessment strategies are presented. Furthermore, a case study for Singapore is conducted to see the impact of the forecasted carbon dioxide prices on the thermoeconomic performance of the micro-cogeneration system.

AB An optimal operations management system of residential energy supply networks employing power and heat interchanges among cogeneration units and storage tanks was developed. This system integrated energy demand prediction, operation scheduling to predicted energy demand using mixed-integer linear programming, and real-time control for the cogeneration units and the heat interchange hierarchically. The energy demand prediction and operation scheduling were updated using a receding horizon approach. The novelty of the study is characterized by developing an operations management framework for heat interchange among storage tanks and by proposing an event-driven receding horizon approach. The developed operations management system was applied to annual operating simulation of a residential energy supply network, consisting of four fuel cell-based cogeneration units and four storage tanks. The results showed that employing the power and heat interchanges increases a reduction rate of annual primary energy consumption by 3.24 and 5.63 percentage points relative to the power interchange operation and separate operation of the cogeneration units, respectively. Moreover, the event-driven receding horizon approach based on heat interchange schedule maintained an energy-saving performance subequal to the conventional receding horizon approach and reduced the daily receding number by 46.7% of the conventional receding horizon approach.

AB This study aimed to develop a simplified estimation model for determining the optimal rooftop PV system for gable roofs that can evaluate life cycle economic and environmental assessment, by considering the type of installation to be used for such rooftop PV system. The military facilities located in three regions (i.e., Gimpo (northern part), Deajeon (middle part), and Pohang (southern part)) in South Korea were selected for the case studies. The results of this study are as follows. First, in terms of NPV25 (net present value in 25 years), for the roofs with a lower orientation, ToI-2(opt), was selected as the optimal rooftop PV system, and for the roofs with a higher orientation, ToI-2(ext). or ToI-3(Opt), was selected as the optimal rooftop PV system. Second, in terms of SIR25 (savings-to-investment ratio in 25 years), for the roofs with a lower orientation, ToI-(ext), was selected as the optimal rooftop PV system, and for the roofs with a higher orientation, ToI-3(Opt). was selected as the optimal rooftop PV system. The simplified estimation model may be useful for decision makers, including experts and non-experts (i.e., architects, owners, construction managers, etc.), or policymakers in determining the optimal rooftop PV system for a gable roof.

AB Polygeneration is an integrated process that produces two or more energy products from one or more primary energy, sources (PES). Polygeneration systems have wide applications in utilities, industrial sectors and building sectors. However, there are still very limited applications of the powerful and practical optimization techniques in polygeneration systems of building sectors comparing to their wide applications in industrial sectors. System optimization is one of effective and reasonable tools to exploit the potential of polygeneration systems. Polygeneration offers potential to fulfill the ambitious target of zero energy building (ZEB) because the interdependence of different energy products can be utilized to provide advantage and flexibility to accommodate more renewable energy sources (RES) in the system. Polygeneration based ZEB can be treated as a type of Polygeneration Microgrid (PM) because PM represents a promising solution to supply electricity, heat and cooling efficiently using local energy sources, including RES. The development of PM is closely associated with building applications.
   Hence, the objective of the present paper is to give a comprehensive review for optimization techniques of polygeneration systems in buildings. The review was conducted based on integrated design, synthesis and operation optimization (IDS00) for different scales of systems, ranging from the micro-scale for a single house to the large-scale for a residential complex, including PM to identify difference between traditional systems and PM in terms of optimization. The literature was classified according to solution techniques of IDS00 and characteristics of IDSOO in terms of decision variables, objective functions and constraints. The results showed that there is no significant difference between traditional systems and PM in terms of solution techniques while there is subtle difference between traditional systems and PM in terms of objective function and constraints. Optimization of PM has higher requirements for real-time management to integrate more RES. Optimization of micro- and small-scale systems are more complicated than large-scale ones because there are many constraints from technical, legal and policy viewpoints. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Hydrologic model development and calibration have continued in most cases to focus only on accurately reproducing streamflows. However, complex models, for example, the so-called physically based models, possess large degrees of freedom that, if not constrained properly, may lead to poor model performance when used for prediction. We argue that constraining a model to represent streamflow, which is an integrated resultant of many factors across the watershed, is necessary but by no means sufficient to develop a high-fidelity model. To address this problem, we develop a framework to utilize the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment's (GRACE) total water storage anomaly data as a supplement to streamflows for model calibration, in a multiobjective setting. The VARS method (Variogram Analysis of Response Surfaces) for global sensitivity analysis is used to understand the model behaviour with respect to streamflow and GRACE data, and the BORG multiobjective optimization method is applied for model calibration. Two subbasins of the Saskatchewan River Basin in Western Canada are used as a case study. Results show that the developed framework is superior to the conventional approach of calibration only to streamflows, even when multiple streamflow-based error functions are simultaneously minimized. It is shown that a range of (possibly false) system trajectories in state variable space can lead to similar (acceptable) model responses. This observation has significant implications for land-surface and hydrologic model development and, if not addressed properly, may undermine the credibility of the model in prediction. The framework effectively constrains the model behaviour (by constraining posterior parameter space) and results in more credible representation of hydrology across the watershed.

AB Heat loss from rotary kilns accounts for certain amounts of the total energy consumption in chemical and metallurgical industries. To reduce the heat loss, a parallel and a series-parallel heat recovery systems with nine heat recovery exchangers are proposed to preheat the cold water in this paper. Experimental measurements are carried out to determine the heat transfer coefficient equations of each heat recovery exchanger. Then, the heat recovery systems are analyzed to deduce the mathematic relation between the design parameters and the system requirements, i.e. the temperatures and heat transfer rates of the nine heat recovery exchangers. The total heat transfer area, the total power consumption and the entropy generation due to heat transfer and fluid flow are set as the objective functions in four multi objective optimization (MOO) cases. With the aid of the genetic algorithm in the Matlab 2015, the optimized operational and structural parameters are obtained. Finally, the MOO results are compared with that of the single objective optimization (SOO) method and the original values. The optimization results show that the MOO method are more suitable for the operational parameters design of the heat recovery systems compared with the SOO method. The required total heat transfer area and the total power consumption are decreased by at least 12.1% and 13.7%, respectively. Besides, as the entropy generation due to heat transfer and fluid flow decrease in the MOO cases, the corresponding heat transfer area and power consumption of the heat recovery system decrease, respectively.

AB Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) are preferred in solving multi-objective optimization problems due to their considerable performance giving decision-maker a set of not only convergent but diversified promising solutions. However, the scalability of MOEAs deteriorates in addressing many objective optimization problems which involve more than three conflicting objectives. The principal reason is largely due to the deficiency of the existing genetic operators which cannot generate promising offspring from parents chosen by the Pareto-dominance rule in these MOEAs. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) generate offspring with a probabilistic model built from the statistics extracting upon existing solutions to expectedly alleviate the weakness arisen in genetic operators. In this paper, a reference line-based EDA is proposed for effectively solving many-objective optimization problems. Specifically, the estimation model is built based on the reference lines in the decision space to sample solutions with favorable proximity. Then solutions with considerable diversity in Pareto-optimal front are selected. These two phases collectively promote the needed convergence and diversity for the proposed algorithm. To evaluate the performance, extensive experiments are performed against four state-of-the-art many objective evolutionary algorithms and two EDAs over DTLZ and WFG test suites with 5-, 8-, 10-, and 15-objective. Experimental results quantified by the selected performance metrics indicate that the proposed algorithm shows significant competitiveness in tackling many-objective optimization problems.

AB Adaptation of sensing period for licensed channel is one of the key requirements to maximise the utilisation of transmission opportunities by a secondary user. A novel objective function evaluation method for sensing period optimisation in cognitive radio network is formulated. A recently introduced optimisation technique, namely Jaya algorithm has been used for achieving the optimum value of sensing period in order to maximise the discovery of spectrum opportunities while maintaining the sensing overhead and interference time within user defined value. This multiobjective optimisation problem involving different constraints is solved using an objective function that introduces penalty for violation of constraints. Results show that the proposed scheme leads to quick adaptation and efficient discovery of spectrum opportunities while satisfying the different QoS constraints, thus making it a better choice for real-time applications.

AB CNC machining is one of the major activities in the manufacturing industry which is responsible for a significant portion of the total consumed energy. However, the energy efficiency of CNC machining is surprisingly low. It is important to provide valuable insights for practitioners to enhance energy efficiency of CNC machining. This paper analyzes the energy consumption characteristics of CNC machining process and exploits the influence factors for energy efficiency improvement through a theoretical analysis. A series of operational strategies for energy efficiency improvement of CNC machining are presented through a review and research framework. The future research directions are identified and summarized for more energy savings. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Power transformer optimal design (PTOD) is a complex multi-objective optimisation problem. Due to large variables search space, most optimisation methods proposed in literature for PTOD are prone to find local minimum instead of the global one. To prevail over the aforementioned problem, this study aims to propose a new heuristic algorithm combined with mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP), and also, some modifications to conventional PTOD procedure. Some promising features of the proposed method in comparison to the previously proposed methods are (i) it considers more design variables as a gene for transformer constructing chromosome (TCC), (ii) before building the main TCC, it divides the PTOD algorithm into some sub-algorithms and starts to construct some sub-chromosomes with lower number of genes as parts of the main TCC, which allows us to detect improper genes based on a sensitivity analysis and design constraints, (iii) not only it considers technical and consumer constrains, but it also take manufacturing constraints into account, (iv) MINLP is used to find global optimum point, and (v) the validity of obtained optimal solution is further assessed by presenting comprehensive finite-element method (FEM) and experimental result.

AB Industrial cyber-physical system is defined as transformative technologies for upgrading the traditional industrial mode. Wireless mesh network becomes a typical technology in industrial cyber-physical system for the network communication with large-scale distributed wireless terminals. However, the robustness of wireless mesh networks in the industrial environment is seriously challenged by worst working reliability of network nodes, more vulnerable wireless communication links, and so on. In this article, in order to enhance network robustness and reliability, we propose a robust collaborative mesh networking method for interconnecting large-scale distributed wireless heterogeneous terminals in industrial cyber-physical systems. First, moderate redundancy of network deployment is introduced to guarantee two-connectivity for each mesh router and two-coverage for each wireless terminal, and an improved metric for evaluating the overall network robustness is presented. Second, the robustness-aware collaborative mesh networking problem is formulated with a multi-objective optimization model, and an improved multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm based on self-adaptive evolutionary learning is exploited to search out the Pareto optimal particles with better distribution and diversity. The experimental results show how the network robustness and load-balancing performance change along with the increasing number of deployed mesh router/mesh gateways, and our method is helpful for finding out a robust wireless mesh network deployment scheme in industrial cyber-physical systems when given a deployment cost.

AB Portfolio selection is one of the most vital financial problems in literature. The studied problem is a nonlinear multi-objective problem which has been solved by a variety of heuristic and metaheuristic techniques. In this article, a metaheuristic optimiser, the multi-objective water cycle algorithm (MOWCA), is represented to find efficient frontiers associated with the standard mean-variance (M-V) portfolio optimisation model. The inspired concept of WCA is based on the simulation of water cycle process in the nature. Computational results are obtained for analyses of daily data for the period January 2012 to December 2014, including S&P100 in the US, Hang Seng in Hong Kong, FTSE100 in the UK, and DAX100 in Germany. The performance of the MOWCA for solving portfolio optimisation problems has been evaluated in comparison with other multi-objective optimisers including the NSGA-II and multi-objective particle swarm optimisation (MOPSO). Four well-known performance metrics are used to compare the reported optimisers. Statistical optimisation results indicate that the applied MOWCA is an efficient and practical optimiser compared with the other methods for handling portfolio optimisation problems.

AB An in-house computer code based on artificial intelligence has been developed and applied in modeling and closed-loop optimization of release behavior of Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) biodegradable particles. A series of micro-and nanoparticles were prepared via water-in-oil-in-water double emulsion to be loaded with albumin-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate as a typical drug. The interrelationship between input variables (molecular weight of polymer and stabilizer, polymer concentration, and sonication rate) and outputs (PLGA particle size and percentage of initial burst) was uncovered with the aid of artificial neural network modeling. The regression analysis confirmed acceptable correlation coefficients for the aforementioned responses, where the PLGA molecular weight played the most important role among the studied variables. Input variables needed to minimize PLGA size and PLGA initial burst were then obtained via multiobjective optimization performed by a genetic algorithm. PLGA nanoparticles were checked for particle size and particle size distribution using scanning electron micrographs. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Designing processes in industrial parks by breaking plant boundaries will produce more resource and economic benefits than just focusing on every single plant. This article addresses the water management problem in industrial parks with considering two major points: (1) the water network synthesis problem towards park scenario in each time period, (2) the multi-period problem resulted from predictable development and adjustment variations of park. To achieve the optimal network configurations and water management plans for the operational scenarios in the future, an optimization mathematical model is formulated based on the proposed network superstructure including indirect water reuse and the planning strategies for multi-period concern. At last, three design cases are illustrated to demonstrate the application of the methodology. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The introduced work aims to systematic optimize detailed short-term scheduling for industrial waste incineration to support daily decision-making processes. The overall objective is to reduce the utilization of auxiliary fuel used to overcome waste related energy in the incineration process. The reduction is achieved through adequate mixing and scheduling of waste streams with different energy content and improved logistic strategies. With it, regulatory and technical constraints are fulfilled and holdups in production processes derived from bottlenecks in the waste treatment are avoided.
   The considered system consists of storage tanks, a piping network, tank wagons for waste transportation, unloading pumps and incineration lances. The optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem with a discrete time representation based on a single uniform grid. It consists of two blocks: i) waste transfer and mixing, and ii) the incineration process itself including energy calculations and constraints.
   The industrial case study of this work shows a saving potential of auxiliary fuel of up to 90%, leading to a reduction of CO2 emissions of up to 13%. Hence, the systematic scheduling of industrial waste incineration leads to an important reduction of auxiliary fuel consumption, resulting in economic and environmental benefits.

AB In this work we study the separation of N-2/CH4 in a bed packed with silicalite. Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is a competitive technology for this task. Predicting PSA performance is a time consuming computational intensive problem. Direct optimization of the system of differential algebraic equations (DAE) describing the phenomena takes an impractical amount of time. We then analyze the suitability of using artificial neural networks (ANN) as a surrogate model to predict and optimize the PSA performance. Using the ANN surrogate model, optimization time decreased from 15.7 h to 50 s. We demonstrate that the PSA cycle proposed can achieve an optimized 99.5% nitrogen purity stream from an 85% inlet stream and a 50% purity stream from a 10% inlet stream. We also show that nitrogen recovery can be at most 90%. We further carry out a multi-objective optimization to demonstrate the tradeoff curve between nitrogen purity and recovery.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) technology with huge number of power-constrained devices has been heralded to improve the operational efficiency of many industrial applications. It is vital to reduce the energy consumption of each device; however, this could also degrade the quality of service (QoS) provisioning. In this paper, we study the problem of how to achieve the tradeoff between the QoS provisioning and the energy efficiency for the industrial IoT systems. We first formulate the multiobjective optimization problem to achieve the objective of balancing the outage performance and the network lifetime. Then, we propose to combine the quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) with the improved nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to obtain the Pareto-optimal front. In particular, NSGA-II is applied to solve the formulated multiobjective optimization problem, and the QPSO algorithm is used to obtain the optimum cooperative coalition. The simulation results suggest that the proposed algorithm can achieve the tradeoff between the energy efficiency and the QoS provisioning by sacrificing about 10% network lifetime but improving about 15% outage performance.

AB In this paper, we tackle the problem of searching for the most favorable pattern of link capacity allocation that makes a power transmission network resilient to cascading failures with limited investment costs. This problem is formulated within a combinatorial multiobjective optimization framework and tackled by evolutionary algorithms. Two different models of increasing complexity are used to simulate cascading failures in a network and quantify its resilience: a complex network model [namely, the Motter-Lai (ML) model] and a more detailed and computationally demanding power flow model [namely, the ORNL-Pserc-Alaska (OPA) model]. Both models are tested and compared in a case study involving the 400-kV French power transmission network. The results show that cascade-resilient networks tend to have a nonlinear capacity-load relation: In particular, heavily loaded components have smaller unoccupied portions of capacity, whereas lightly loaded links present larger unoccupied portions of capacity (which is in contrast with the linear capacity-load relation hypothesized in previous works of literature). Most importantly, the optimal solutions obtained using the ML and OPA models exhibit consistent characteristics in terms of phrase transitions in the Pareto fronts and link capacity allocation patterns. These results provide incentive for the use of computationally cheap network-centric models for the optimization of cascade-resilient power network systems, given the advantages of their simplicity and scalability.

AB We present the algorithm SOCEMO for optimization problems that have multiple conflicting computationally expensive black-box objective functions. The computational expense arising from the objective function evaluations considerably restricts the number of evaluations that can be done to find Pareto-optimal solutions. Frequently used multiobjective optimization methods are based on evolutionary strategies and generally require a prohibitively large number of function evaluations to find a good approximation of the Pareto front. SOCEMO, in contrast, employs surrogate models to approximate the expensive objective functions. These surrogate models are used in the iterative sampling process to decide at which points in the variable domain the next expensive evaluations should be done. Therefore, fewer expensive objective function evaluations are needed, and a good approximation of the Pareto front can be found efficiently. Previous algorithms have generally been tested on problems with few variables (up to 10) and few objective functions (up to 5). In our numerical study, we show that our algorithm performs well for benchmark problems with up to 35 dimensions and up to 10 objective functions, as well as two engineering application problems. We compared the performance of SOCEMO to a variant of NSGA-II and show that SOCEMO's sophisticated search strategy is more efficient than NSGA-II when the number of allowable function evaluations is low.

AB Computational tools for early architectural design need to address issues related to building performance and integrally consider early design decisions regarding building form, spatial layout, orientation, and envelope articulation. This paper presents (1) a design optimization tool, Multiobjective Architectural Design Explorer (MADE) that supports performative-based building design, and (2) a design exploration strategy that effectively operationalizes MADE for Pareto-based comparative search. MADE implements genetic optimization in two steps. It first generates building layouts that satisfy formal, topological, and placement constraints with a singleobjective genetic algorithm. Then, MADE determines the opening sizes of the generated layout(s) by optimizing the buildings' energy and daylighting performance with a multiobjective genetic algorithm. MADE is tested on the design of a library building and the proposed Pareto-based exploration strategy is demonstrated in the selection of an optimal design. The results point out the feasibility of the presented tool and the design strategy, and that multiple objectives can be satisfied by sequentially optimizing design objectives.

AB This paper addresses the airport facility location problem considering environmental impacts and induced changes to traffic on the underlying road network. An optimization model is developed, where multiple objectives are defined including (1) minimizing total noise disruption caused by operating aircraft from the airport; (2) maximizing the coverage of the airport through minimizing the distance between the airport and the demand nodes; and (3) minimizing the total travel time of users on the road network, considering the demand-inducing nature of the airport. The problem is formulated as a bilevel program, and is solved using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. The model is then tested on an illustrative case study. Results highlight the great potential of adopting the proposed model as a decision support tool for locating an airport. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB In this review, I discuss the basic principles of joint inversion and constrained inversion approaches and show a few instructive examples of applications of these approaches in the literature. Starting with some basic definitions of the terms joint inversion and constrained inversion, I use a simple three-layered model as a tutorial example that demonstrates the general properties of joint inversion with different coupling methods. In particular, I investigate to which extent combining different geophysical methods can restrict the set of acceptable models and under which circumstances the results can be biased. Some ideas on how to identify such biased results and how negative results can be interpreted conclude the tutorial part. The case studies in the second part have been selected to highlight specific issues such as choosing an appropriate parameter relationship to couple seismic and electromagnetic data and demonstrate the most commonly used approaches, e.g., the cross-gradient constraint and direct parameter coupling. Throughout the discussion, I try to identify topics for future work. Overall, it appears that integrating electromagnetic data with other observations has reached a level of maturity and is starting to move away from fundamental proof-of-concept studies to answering questions about the structure of the subsurface. With a wide selection of coupling methods suited to different geological scenarios, integrated approaches can be applied on all scales and have the potential to deliver new answers to important geological questions.

AB This article aims to create a theoretical evaluation model based on decision support methods for the residential house construction materials and elements selection. The research and analyses of most of the scientists are invoked on individual elements and materials of the building, which have an impact on different aspects of sustainability. Meanwhile, the integrated model covering all the key elements and materials of the single-family residential house has not been implemented. Thus, the problem of development of the general composite model of the element and material selection of single-family buildings is acute in many countries around the world.
   Our study assessed the specific technical parameters related to building materials: cost, thermal bridging, and load-bearing capacity, the outer material selection according to localisation, environmental performance, durability, weight. SWARA (Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis) approach is applied to decision making to calculate the relative importance of the criteria. A single-valued neutrosophic set governs the proposed new extension of MULTIMOORA (Multiobjective Optimisation by Ratio Analysis Plus Full Multiplicative Form) method and allows to deal explicitly with the indeterminacy of the initial information. Our proposed new theoretical composite model for selection of elements, materials and other aspects of sustainability can be practically applied in creating the decision support system for the selection of single-family house elements and materials.

AB This paper presents detailed energy and exergy analysis and comparison of low-grade solar heat source powered superheated and saturated organic Rankine cycle (ORC) using zeotropic mixture butane/R1234ze. The required expression to evaluate the power output, first law efficiency exergetic efficiency, exergy destruction, and required heat exchangers area are coded in Matlab 2015a interfaced with REFPROP 9.0. Moreover, saturated and superheated ORCs are further optimized by genetic algorithm by selecting exergetic efficiency and product of overall heat transfer coefficient and heat exchanger area. It is observed that superheated ORC exhibits better net power output, first law, and exergetic efficiency, lower exergy destruction, and poorer economy than saturated ORC. Further, the performance of saturated ORC is increased by 34.02% and that of superheated ORC by 17.06% by the multiobjective genetic algorithm. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB Drilling faces many complex design and multiobjective optimization problems. Solving these problems is also a critical and complicated part of drilling optimization as part of well trajectory design and optimization. Many researchers have developed many algorithms, but they have some disadvantages. We take the shortest total borehole length, the highest target shooting accuracy, the lowest cost, and the minimum friction as the multiobjective function, and we use a fish swarm algorithm for trajectory optimization. In this paper, we present the idea of using a nondominant relation for sorting in the algorithm and we also use an optimization program in the Matlab software to obtain all numerical solutions satisfying the constraints. Therefore it is quite adaptable for introducing the idea of nondominant sorting into appropriate multiobjective optimization problems based on a fish swarm algorithm. We give an example of the calculation, and also show that the algorithm and the calculation procedure are accurate and reliable. The algorithm has a simple structure, a small number of calculations, and good convergence.

AB Expansion planning is one of the most important issues in the power system studies because of its significant effect on the operation and maintenance in the future. This paper presents a new model for dynamic expansion planning in the power market in which simultaneous expansion of generation and transmission is addressed based on a multiobjective framework. The costs of investment, congestion, and loss of load are considered in the problem formulation as three objectives. The impacts of transmission line losses and different investment scenarios on the planning objectives are also investigated. For us to overcome the difficulties of solving this nonconvex and mixed integer optimization problem, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II followed by the fuzzy satisfying method is used to obtain the final optimal solution. The methodology yields a set of solutions so that final plan can be selected according to different planning policies. The proposed method has been applied to the IEEE 24-bus, Iranian northeastern 400-kV power grid and Iranian 400-kV simplified network to justify the performance of the proposed method. Different cases are analyzed, and the obtained results approve the applicability of the proposed approach in real power systems.

AB The extended black-start strategy is new exploration for black-start restoration of power systems, in which more than one non-black-start unit can be restored simultaneously during the black-start stage. This paper presents a multiobjective optimization method coordinating unit restarting with load restoration for extended black-start decision making. The objective functions of the black-start restoration optimization are defined as restoring non-black-start units and unserved loads as much as possible under steady-state and transient system operation constraints. A hybrid algorithm combining the lexicographic method with the improved bacterial foraging algorithm is used to solve the defined optimization model. The proposed method has been tested on the IEEE 118-bus system and the southern Hebei power system of China, and the test results verify the effectiveness of the proposed decision-making method.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB In this study, we propose a novel hybrid multiobjective evolutionary algorithm for solving multiobjective quadratic assignment problems. During the last decade, the researchers gave increasing attention to the multiobjective structure of quadratic assignment problems and developed and/or used several multi objective metaheuristics. The nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) has been shown to solve various multiobjective problems much better than other recently-proposed constraint handling approaches. Besides, the effectiveness of conic scalarization method was also proven for solution of multiobjective problems, that have non-linear structure. Here, a hybrid multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (cNSGA-II) featured with NSGA-II and conic scalarization's Pareto solutions is developed to obtain as much Pareto points, as possible. To test the performance of the algorithm we have selected the test problems from the literature and compared the performances by well-known diameter metric. It has been shown that cNSGA-II is effective in solving multiobjective quadratic assignment problems.

AB Reducing energy consumption and increasing ethylene recovery rate can effectively optimize the operation of ethylene columns. This paper discusses the trade-off between energy consumption and recovery rate in different scenes. For normal condition, the influences of energy consumption and recovery rate on economic benefits are represented as energy consumption of separation and energy consumption of circulation, while the unseparated ethylene is recycled by the bottom circulatory system. The operation optimization, whose objective is economic benefits, is achieved at the lowest total energy consumption, the sum of energy consumption of separation and circulation. For abnormal condition caused by furnace decoking, the objectives of operation optimization are economic benefits and operability. Operability, affected with remarkable production fluctuation, is quantified by variation of gas and liquid loads. Moreover, the Pareto curve of the multiobjective optimization problem was obtained with total energy consumption and variation of gas/liquid loads as objectives, and the inflection point achieves the equilibrium of economic benefits and operability. Therefore, the balance of recovery rate and energy consumption is crucial to improve economic benefits. Furthermore, moderately operating recovery rate and energy consumption is suitable to maximize economic benefits and operability simultaneously for production fluctuation.

AB A thermodynamic and economic assessment of an innovative scheme to repower a thermal power plant is presented here. A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) plant is incorporated at upstream of the present boiler and a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) plant is incorporated at downstream of present boiler. Coal feeds are reduced (reduction varied from 10% to 40%) by partially off-loading the mills. Energy, equivalent to that replaced coal, is provided by the exhaust of the direct internal reforming (DIR) SOFC which runs on natural gas. The MCFC plant also consumes some fresh natural gas and separates CO2 from the boiler exhaust. The proposed model, developed and analyzed using Cycle Tempo software, yields better performance while substantially increasing the plant capacity (more than 50%) and reducing the CO2 emission (90%). The findings suggest that at 20% coal replacement the plant becomes most economical, offering electricity at an estimated unit cost of USD 84/MWh, as against USD 111/MWh for MEA retrofitted plant.

AB Global climate models (GCMs) are examples of high-dimensional input-output systems, where model output is a function of many variables, and an update in model physics commonly improves performance in one objective function (i.e., measure of model performance) at the expense of degrading another. Here concepts from multiobjective optimization in the engineering literature are used to investigate parameter sensitivity and optimization in the face of such trade-offs. A metamodeling technique called cut high-dimensional model representation (cut-HDMR) is leveraged in the context of multiobjective optimization to improve GCM simulation of the tropical Pacific climate, focusing on seasonal precipitation, column water vapor, and skin temperature. An evolutionary algorithm is used to solve for Pareto fronts, which are surfaces in objective function space along which trade-offs in GCM performance occur. This approach allows the modeler to visualize trade-offs quickly and identify the physics at play. In some cases, Pareto fronts are small, implying that trade-offs are minimal, optimal parameter value choices are more straightforward, and the GCM is well-functioning. In all cases considered here, the control run was found not to be Pareto-optimal (i.e., not on the front), highlighting an opportunity for model improvement through objectively informed parameter selection. Taylor diagrams illustrate that these improvements occur primarily in field magnitude, not spatial correlation, and they show that specific parameter updates can improve fields fundamental to tropical moist processes-namely precipitation and skin temperature-without significantly impacting others. These results provide an example of how basic elements of multiobjective optimization can facilitate pragmatic GCM tuning processes.

AB Gear train optimization problems (GTOPs) can be very difficult. This paper proposes an enumerative optimization procedure (EOP) for the GTOP of a two-speed dedicated electric transmission (2DET) for electric vehicles (EVs). The EOP combines enumeration with the Min-Max Principle of Optimality (MMPO). First, the requirements of the EV and the requirements of manufacture and operation were checked in a dedicated order to obtain the feasible region of the GTOP. Then, the MMPO was implemented within the feasible region to reveal the global optimum in terms of the performance of the EV, the load capacity of the gears and the size of the gear train (GT). Results demonstrated that the EOP was effective in determining the feasible region and simultaneously and globally optimizing multiple criteria for the GTOP. The idea of combining enumeration with optimization, as the EOP presents, may be helpful to solve other GTOPs and provide global optima that are immediately practical and applicable.

AB This paper presents a novel evolutionary strategy for multiobjective optimization in which a population's evolution is guided by exploiting the geometric structure of its Pareto front. Specifically, the Pareto front of a particle population is regarded as a set of scattered points on which interpolation is performed using a geometric curve/surface model to construct a geometric parameter space. On this basis, the normal direction of this space can be obtained and the solutions located exactly in this direction are chosen as the guiding points. Then, the dominated solutions are processed by using a local optimization technique with the help of these guiding points. Particle populations can thus evolve toward optimal solutions with the guidance of such a geometric structure. The strategy is employed to develop a fast and robust algorithm based on correlation analysis for solving the optimization problems with more than three objectives. A number of computational experiments have been conducted to compare the algorithm to another three popular multiobjective algorithms. As demonstrated in the experiments, the proposed algorithm achieves remarkable performance in terms of the solutions obtained, robustness, and speed of convergence.

AB Fast and safe charging protocols are crucial for enhancing the practicality of batteries, especially for mobile applications, such as smartphones and electric vehicles. This paper proposes an innovative approach to devising optimally health-conscious fast-safe charge protocols. A multiobjective optimal control problem is mathematically formulated via a coupled electro-thermal-aging battery model, where electrical and aging submodels depend upon the core temperature captured by a two-state thermal submodel. The Legendre-Gauss-Radau pseudospectral method with adaptive multi-mesh-interval collocation is employed to solve the resulting highly nonlinear six-state optimal control problem. Charge time and health degradation are, therefore, optimally traded off, subject to both electrical and thermal constraints. Minimum-time, minimum-aging, and balanced charge scenarios are examined in detail. Sensitivities to the upper voltage bound, ambient temperature, and cooling convection resistance are investigated as well. Experimental results are provided to compare the tradeoffs between a balanced and traditional charge protocol.

AB This paper uses optimization techniques to obtain bow hull form of a 66,000 DWT bulk carrier in calm water and in waves. Parametric modification functions of SAC and section shape of DLWL are used for hull form variation. Multi-objective functions are applied to minimize the wave-making resistance in calm water and added resistance in regular head wave of lambda/L = 0.5. WAVIS version 1.3 is used to obtain wave making resistance. The modified Fujii and Takahashi's formula is applied to obtain the added resistance in short wave. The PSO algorithm is employed for the optimization technique. The resistance and motion characteristics in calm water and regular and irregular head waves of the three hull forms are compared. It has been shown that the optimal brings 13.2% reduction in the wave -making resistance and 13.8% reduction in the added resistance at lambda/L = 0.5; and the mean added resistance reduces by 9.5% at sea state 5.

AB The increased use of carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRP) has raised the environmental concerns on waste disposal and consumption of non-renewable resources as well as economic awareness for the need to recycle CFRP wastes stemming from aircraft. This study develops an optimisation approach of CFRP waste management with the simultaneous objective of minimising cost and global warming potential impacts along the the entire network. Various CFRP waste types are involved with multiple available techniques of fibre/no-fibre recovery techniques. The scenarios that are investigated are based on the current situation in France. The large inventory of the existing sites concerning aerospace CFRP industry is carried out to predict the waste quantity that is likely to be generated in the future. The objective is to develop waste allocation strategies, which are both good for economic and environmental aspects. The results obtained show that the economic interest and the environmental effect are conflicting. Transportation turns out to be an important factor of waste management.

AB Modern video games come with highly realistic graphics enabling the players to interact with visually rich virtual worlds. Realistic (life-like) animation of nonplayer characters (NPCs) in such virtual worlds is particularly important to enhance the gaming experience. Multiagent systems are one effective approach to synthesize life-like behaviors and interactions by codifying simple rules into NPCs (each NPC as an autonomous agent). However, such behaviors generally come at the cost of increasing computational expense and complexity in terms of aspects such as number of rules and parameters. Therefore, the desire for high fidelity (highly realistic) behaviors is often in conflict with the drive for low complexity. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms provide a sophisticated mechanism to optimize two or more conflicting objectives simultaneously. However, evolutionary computing techniques need an appropriate objective function to drive the exploration in the correct direction. Pairing of evolutionary techniques and multiagent systems is challenging in the classes of problems in which the fitness is evaluated based on human aesthetic judgment rather than on objective forms of measurements. In this study, we present a multiobjective evolutionary framework to evolve low complexity and high fidelity multiagent systems by utilizing a machine learning system trained by bootstrapping human aesthetic judgment. We have gathered empirical data in three problem areas-simulation of conversational group dynamics, sheepdog herding behaviors, and traffic dynamics, and show the effectiveness of our approach in deriving low complexity and high fidelity multiagent systems. Further, we have identified common properties of the Pareto-optimal frontiers in the three problem areas that can ultimately lead to an understanding of a relationship between simulation model complexity and behavior fidelity. This understanding will be useful in deciding which level of behavioral fidelity is required for the characters in video games based on the distance to the camera, importance to the scene, and available computational resources.

   OBJECTIVES
AB The Pareto (or nondominated set) for a multiobjective optimization problem is often of nontrivial size, and the decision maker may have a difficult time establishing objective criterion weights to select a solution. In light of these issues, clustering or partitioning methods can be of considerable value for pruning the Pareto set and limiting the decision to a few choice exemplars. A three-stage approach is proposed. In stage one, a variance-to-range measure is used to normalize the criterion function values. In stage two, maximum split partitioning and p-median partitioning are each applied to the normalized measures, thus producing two partitions of the Pareto set and two sets of exemplars. Finally, in stage three, the union of the exemplars obtained by the two partitioning methods is accepted as the final set of exemplars. The partitioning methods are compared within the context of multiobjective allocation of a cross-trained workforce to achieve both operational and human resource objectives. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Verified static and dynamic models of an operational works were used alongside Monte-Carlo conditions and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NGSAII) to optimise operational regimes. Static models were found to be more suitable for whole water treatment works optimisation modelling and offered the additional advantage of reduced computational burden. Static models were shown to predict solutions of comparable cost when applied to optimisation problems while being faster to simulate than dynamic models.

AB Parameter calibration is an important step in the development of rainfall-runoff models. Recently, there has been a significant focus on automatic calibration. In this paper, two evolutionary optimization algorithms were applied to calibration of the long-and short-term runoff model (LST model) to simulate the daily rainfall-runoff process in the Be River catchment located in southern Vietnam. The differential evolution (DE) and evolution strategy (ES) algorithms were employed to optimize three objective functions: the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, root mean square error, and mean absolute error, which are indices for evaluating the simulation accuracy of the LST model. Hydrometeorological data for the periods 1985-1989 and 1990-1991 were used for calibration and validation, respectively. The LST model was calibrated for each objective function using five different parent and offspring population conditions. The results show that both the DE and ES algorithms are efficient methods for automatic calibration of the LST model. After 1000 generations, the best values of the fitness indices found by the DE technique were slightly better and more stable than those found by the ES technique in both calibration and validation. The average computation time for each generation using the DE algorithm was approximately two-thirds as long as that using the ES algorithm.

AB The purpose of this study was to analyze train driver injuries under secondary impact and to optimize the driver workspace to reduce the driver impact injury risk. The console-seat-dummy collision analysis model of train cab is established using MADYMO. The driver dynamic impact response and the driver injury results were obtained from the collision model. The optimization of driver workspace parameters was conducted to reduce the driver injury risk. Fifteen samples were chosen for numerical simulation based on the optimal Latin hypercube design; the polynomial response surface methodology was adopted to fit the relationship between the driver injury criteria and the workspace parameters. The driver injury results show that the driver injury is considerably severe. The optimization results indicate that the driver injury is minimal when factors A, B, C, and D are 356.6mm, 404.6mm, 145mm, and 200mm, respectively. Compared with the initial collision model, all six driver injury criteria after optimization decrease obviously and are well within the tolerance limits, respectively. The analysis of the optimization results and the results of computer simulation refined after the optimization confirm that the optimization results show good correlation with the injury results of the collision numerical model and the effectiveness of the optimization design in reducing the severity of the driver injury during a secondary impact.

AB This paper addresses the detailed assignment of nurses to surgical operations taking into account the skills requirements. We consider the building of weekly nurse schedule roster by assigning the nurses to surgical operations while generating teams which have strong affinities and minimising nurse idle times. Nurses are assigned to shifts based on their availability, legal constraints on their working hours and the elective surgery schedule. Building on the epsilon-constraint method, we propose a new bi-objective approach that can solve the problem faster and more accurately, as well as provide insight into the trade-offs between the two objectives. The approach is also used to gain more insight into the problem and evaluate the impact of nurse settings. In this paper, we considered the impact of using circulating and scrub nurses or using polyvalent (multi-skilled) nurses. In all instances and settings, the affinities between the surgical team members were more sensitive to variations in idle time. Furthermore, the use of polyvalent (multi-skilled) nurses yielded rosters with reduced idle time and better surgical team member affinities.

AB Recently, Luc defined a dual program for a multiple objective linear program. The dual problem is also a multiple objective linear problem and the weak duality and strong duality theorems for these primal and dual problems have been established. Here, we use these results to prove some relationships between multiple objective linear primal and dual problems. We extend the available results on single objective linear primal and dual problems to multiple objective linear primal and dual problems. Complementary slackness conditions for efficient solutions, and conditions for the existence of weakly efficient solution sets and existence of strictly primal and dual feasible points are established. We show that primal-dual (weakly) efficient solutions satisfying strictly complementary conditions exist. Furthermore, we consider Isermann's and Kolumban's dual problems and establish conditions for the existence of strictly primal and dual feasible points. We show the existence of primal-dual feasible points satisfying strictly complementary conditions for Isermann's dual problem. Also, we give an alternative proof to establish necessary conditions for weakly efficient solutions of multiple objective programs, assuming the Kuhn-Tucker (KT) constraint qualification. We also provide a new condition to ensure the KT constraint qualification.

AB This study introduces an optimisation-based procedure for characterising switched reluctance machine (SRM) performance and studies the optimisation to determine the conduction angles in SRM drives. The objectives employed in the optimisation cases are maximising average output torque, maximising the ratio of average torque over root mean square (RMS) value of phase current, and minimising RMS value of net torque ripple. Combinations of these objectives are used in four different cases, which are formulated either as single- or multi-objective problems. These cases are then compared in terms of output torque, torque ripple, and efficiency. One method of the four is selected and the performance of the motor over the entire operating range is characterised based on optimised turn-on and turn-off angles. Experimental results are used to verify the motor performance obtained from the optimisations for selected operating points.

AB Integrated urban water management (IUWM) considering alternative water supply options is attracting increasing attention from water resources managers due to its efficiency and flexibility in addressing water scarcity problems. Adelaide, the capital of South Australia, is an example of a city where water supply security has come under increasing pressure due to population growth, climate variability, and climate change, as well as emerging environmental needs. In order to address this issue, the South Australian government has committed to implementing IUWM principles through a number of actions including an initiative to integrate alternative water source options for metropolitan Adelaide, called the Urban Water Blueprint. This study is part of the optimal water resources mix (OWRM) project, which was initiated by the South Australian government through the Goyder Institute for Water Research to inform the development of the Urban Water Blueprint. In this study, a multiobjective optimization-based IUWM approach is applied to Adelaide to identify its optimal water supply portfolios and, in turn, to inform policy aimed at prioritizing the development of different types of potential water resources. These sources include traditional water sources, such as surface water from reservoirs and rivers, as well as alternative water sources, such as desalinated sea water, harvested stormwater, and reclaimed wastewater. In addition to the traditional objectives of minimizing economic cost and energy consumption (or the associated greenhouse gas emissions) and maximizing reliability, the impact of stormwater and wastewater discharge on receiving waters is also considered. The results demonstrate that for Adelaide, the optimal mix of sources contains water from traditional surface water sources, harvested stormwater, and reclaimed wastewater. Traditional surface water is a low-cost and low-energy source; reclaimed wastewater is likely to have significant environmental benefits in the long term.

AB Partitioning water distribution networks into district metered areas (DMAs) is a challenge for water utilities due to the complexity of network topology, especially for large-scale and highly looped water supply systems. This paper presents a novel approach, using complex network theory and multiobjective optimization, for efficiently partitioning of water distribution networks. In this approach, a water distribution network is first mapped on to a weighted undirected graph, and its strength is measured by an extended modularity by a random walk strategy. Then, the Louvain algorithm is employed for network partitioning based on the modularity. Finally, boundary pipes between DMAs are determined by applying an evolutionary algorithm to minimize the number of boundary pipes and maximize the network pressure and water age uniformity. The approach has been tested on a real-world distribution system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The results indicate that the method is effective at partitioning the network into DMAs with a similar pressure and water age. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB The management of water flow using reservoirs for the purpose of hydropower production can have significant impacts on solute transport. Reducing the phosphorous load to downstream areas can be of great importance for aquatic habitats associated with recipient waters, as well as for the overall health of coastal and estuary areas. This study demonstrates a combined operation of a network of reservoirs with the objectives of hydropower production and improvement of water quality in downstream areas using a multiobjective approach and incorporating the transport of phosphorous in the watershed. A genetic optimization method was used to determine the trade-off between power production and mitigation of phosphorous discharge in the reservoir network of the Dalalven River, Sweden. The phosphorous export can be reduced (-5%) with a limited loss of power production (-4.3%), but further reduction is associated with a significant loss in total power production. The trade-off between the two objectives is determined using Pareto diagrams and examined for varying particulate conditions. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB A genetic algorithm based on real parameter representation using a variable selection pressure and variable probability of mutation is used to optimize an annular air breathing rocket inlet called the Exchange Inlet. A rapid and accurate design method which provides estimates for air breathing, mixing, and isentropic flow performance is used as the engine of the optimization routine. Comparison to detailed numerical simulations show that the design method yields desired exit Mach numbers to within approximately 1% over 75% of the annular exit area and predicts entrained air massflows to between 1% and 9% of numerically simulated values depending on the flight condition. Optimum designs are shown to be obtained within approximately 8000 fitness function evaluations in a search space on the order of 10(6). The method is also shown to be able to identify beneficial values for particular alleles when they exist while showing the ability to handle cases where physical and aphysical designs co-exist at particular values of a subset of alleles within a gene. For an air breathing engine based on a hydrogen fuelled rocket an exchange inlet is designed which yields a predicted air entrainment ratio within 95% of the theoretical maximum.

AB Application of multivariate adaptive regression spline ensembles (En-MARS) in a coupled simulation-optimization methodology to derive multiple-objective optimal groundwater extraction strategies for a multilayered coastal aquifer system is demonstrated. Two conflicting objectives of groundwater extraction strategies are solved using a controlled elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm. A three-dimensional density-dependent coupled flow and salt-transport numerical simulation model is used to generate the training patterns of groundwater extraction strategies and resulting saltwater concentrations. Prediction capability of En-MARS is compared with that of the best multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) model in the ensemble. En-MARS is then linked externally within the optimization algorithm to develop the management model. The optimal solutions obtained from the En-MARS models are verified by running the numerical simulation model. The results indicate that MARS-based ensemble modeling approach is able to provide reliable solutions for a multilayered coastal aquifer management problem. The adaptive nature of MARS models and use of ensembles and parallel processing results in a computationally efficient, accurate, and reliable methodology for coastal aquifer management that also incorporates uncertainties in modeling.

AB An integrated approach is presented in this study to design electrical hubs combining optimization, multi-criterion assessment and decision making. Levelized Energy Cost (LEC), Initial Capital Cost (ICC), Grid Integration Level (GI), Levelized CO2 emission (LCO2), utilization of renewable energy, flexibility of the system, loss of load probability (LOLP) are considered as criteria used to assess the design. The novel approach consists of several steps. Pareto analysis is conducted initially using 2D Pareto fronts to reduce the dimensions of the optimization problem. Subsequently, Pareto multi objective optimization is conducted considering EEC, GI and ICC which were identified as the best set of objective functions to represent the design requirements. Next, fuzzy TOPSIS and level diagrams are used for multi-criterion decision making (MCDM) considering the set of criteria and the boundary matrix that represents the design requirements of the application. Pareto analysis shows that 5D optimization problem can be reduced to a 3D optimization problem when considering LEC, ICC and GI as the objective functions. Finally, results obtained from the case study shows that the novel method can be used design distributed energy systems considering a set of criteria which is beyond the reach of Pareto optimization with different priority levels.

AB In the present paper, we establish some results for the existence of optimal solutions in vector optimization in infinite-dimensional spaces, where the optimality notion is understood in the sense of generalized order (may not be convex and/or conical). This notion is induced by the concept of set extremality and covers many of the conventional notions of optimality in vector optimization. Some sufficient optimality conditions for optimal solutions of a class of vector optimization problems, which satisfies the free disposal hypothesis, are also examined.

AB Nickel-based super alloy (such as Inconel) is widely used in aerospace, nuclear, and chemical industries because of its excellent mechanical and chemical properties at elevated temperatures. Inconel comes under the category of "difficult-to-cut" materials. Difficulty is faced whilst machining of Inconel because of its poor thermal conductivity, high toughness, high hardness, and extremely high work hardening behaviour. Moreover, it contains highly abrasive carbide particles which tend to stick on the tool surface, resulting in inferior surface finish. Moreover, enormous heat is generated during machining which leads to reduction in tool life. Hence, machining and machinability aspects of Inconel have become a predominant research agenda today. Technological advances have led to an extensive usage of high strength, high hardness materials in manufacturing industries. In course of machining of "difficult-to-cut" materials, conventional manufacturing processes are increasingly being replaced by the advanced techniques such as electro-discharge machining (EDM), ultrasonic machining, electro-chemical machining and laser machining. Amongst these, EDM has found widespread application in micro-electro-mechanical systems; tool and die, automobile and aerospace industries. Therefore, promoting the quality of the EDMed product and thereby achieving satisfactory machining performance; a thorough understanding of the relationship between the EDM parameters and the machined surface integrity in consideration with the tool-work combination has become an important research focus. EDM is an electro-thermal machining process, where electrical energy is used to generate electrical spark and material removal mainly occurs due to thermal energy of the spark. It has become an excellent option to machine "difficult-to-cut" materials and high temperature resistant alloys; super alloy Inconel, in the present case. An experimental investigation on assessing machining performance during EDM of Inconel 625, 718, 601 and 825 has been delineated herein. Attempt has been made on evaluating optimal machining parameters setting to achieve satisfactory machining yield. Based on 5-factor-4-level L-16 orthogonal array, experiments have been carried out by varying gap voltage, peak current, pulse-on time, duty factor and flushing pressure (each varied at four discrete levels) to examine the extent of machining performance in terms of material removal rate, electrode wear rate, surface roughness, and surface crack density of EDMed end products obtained by utilizing different parameters settings (for Inconel of different grades, respectively). An integrated optimization route combining satisfaction function approach, fuzzy inference system in conjugation with Taguchi's philosophy has been proposed for simultaneous optimization of aforementioned multiple performance indices. The most favourable machining parameters setting have been obtained as: [gap voltage = 90 V, peak current = 5 A, pulse-on time = 200 A mu s, duty factor = 70%, flushing pressure = 0.6 bar] for Inconel 625; [gap voltage = 90 V, peak current = 5 A, pulse-on time = 200 A mu s, duty factor = 85%, flushing pressure = 0.4 bar] for Inconel 718; [gap voltage = 80 V, peak current = 7 A, pulse-on time = 500 A mu s, duty factor = 80%, flushing pressure = 0.3 bar] for Inconel 601; and [gap voltage = 80 V, peak current = 5 A, pulse-on time = 300 A mu s, duty factor = 85%, flushing pressure = 0.4 bar] for Inconel 825.
   In addition to that, analysis of SEM micro-graphs has been carried out to understand surface irregularities in terms of surface cracks, white layer for EDMed Inconel end products (of different grades).

AB Cost-Safety tradeoff analysis is one of the most challenging tasks of structural maintenance. Undoubtedly, developing an economic and efficient schedule for structural maintenance and rehabilitation is highly acknowledged. While meta-heuristic optimization algorithms have been used widely to determine the best maintenance strategies to provide more economical structures, we present a mathematical programming model to overcome the limitations of previous studies. In this paper a Mixed Integer Non-linear Programming (MINLP) has been presented to find the optimal time of applying maintenance intervention in a deteriorating structure. While, considering the time value of money, postponing the maintenance actions will be more economic, this postponement may cause a decrease in the safety of structures. Due to this contradictory relation between the objectives, it is vital to find a reasonable trade-off between cost-safety. Our proposed approach considers different values of the discount rate of money. We apply our mathematical programming model to solve two optimization examples, which are found in the structural maintenance literature. It is shown that our proposed model is able to determine the optimal time of applying maintenance intervention to the structures with less total life cycle cost, and higher level of safety.

AB Firefly algorithm (FA) is a new swarm intelligence optimization method, which has shown good search abilities on many optimization problems. However, the performance of FA highly depends on its control parameters. In this paper, we investigate the control parameters of FA, and propose a modified FA called FA with adaptive control parameters (ApFA). To verify the performance of ApFA, experiments are conducted on a set of well-known benchmark problems. Results show that the ApFA outperforms the standard FA and five other recently proposed FA variants.

AB Performance of an early warning system composed of online monitoring sensors for protecting municipal water supply is dependent on the number of sensors deployed. The inherent trade-off of performance versus scale of the system implemented is explored in this paper through multiobjective optimization using an augmented messy genetic algorithm (mGA). The augmented messy GA facilitated the comparison of solutions with variability in the number of sensors deployed. In this paper an early warning system is represented by a system of fixed sensors placed at network junctions, inline mobile sensors deployed from network junctions carried by flow within network pipes, and surface transceivers to communicate wirelessly with mobile sensors for data transmission and analysis. Performance of the implemented early warning system was measured as the time required for contamination detection, the detection likelihood, the population affected prior to event detection, and the total system cost for a small-, medium-, and large- scale municipal network. Results show well-defined Pareto fronts for each objective versus the cost of each solution, providing a tool for designers to optimize budget decisions. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB The main framework of a new adaptive coordinated voltage control (ACVC) has been presented and published in our previous paper. ACVC is realized based on knowledge exploration from nondominated solution sets of multiobjective optimization. Knowledge is prepared and accumulated from offline training and online learning processes. This facilitates fast responses. An important basic work is to further study knowledge sensitivity to power system characteristics such that the efficiency of ACVC for various dynamics of power systems can be improved. A comparative study and discussion of power system scale, allocation of control devices, operational point variations, and severity of emergencies are presented in this paper. An improved form of knowledge is also proposed for ACVC based on these discussions. Numerical simulations on the IEEE 39-bus, 118-bus, and 300-bus power systems are performed for comparison and discussion.

AB Passive dynamic systems have the advantage over conventional robotic systems that they do not require actuators and control. Brachiating, in particular, involves the swinging motion of an animal from one branch to the next. Such systems are usually designed manually by human designers and often are bio-inspired. However, a computational design approach has the capability to search vast design spaces and find solutions that go beyond those possible by manual design. This paper addresses the automated design of passive dynamic systems by introducing a graph grammar-based method that integrates dynamic simulation to evaluate and evolve configurations. In particular, the method is shown to find different, new solutions to the problem of the design of two-dimensional passive, dynamic, continuous contact, brachiating robots. The presented graph grammar rules preserve symmetry among robot topologies. A separation of parametric multiobjective optimization and topologic synthesis is proposed, considering four objectives: number of successful swings, deviation from cyclic motion, required space, and number of bodies. The results show that multiple solutions with varying complexity are found that trade-off cyclic motion and the space required. Compared to research on automated design synthesis of actuated and controlled robotic systems, this paper contributes a new method for passive dynamic systems that integrates dynamic simulation.

AB The growing neural gas (GNG) self-organizing neural network stands as one of the most successful examples of unsupervised learning of a graph of processing units. Despite its success, little attention has been devoted to its extension to a hierarchical model, unlike other models such as the self-organizing map, which has many hierarchical versions. Here, a hierarchical GNG is presented, which is designed to learn a tree of graphs. Moreover, the original GNG algorithm is improved by a distinction between a growth phase where more units are added until no significant improvement in the quantization error is obtained, and a convergence phase where no unit creation is allowed. This means that a principled mechanism is established to control the growth of the structure. Experiments are reported, which demonstrate the self-organization and hierarchy learning abilities of our approach and its performance for vector quantization applications.

AB One of the main current applications of intelligent systems is recommender systems (RS). RS can help users to find relevant items in huge information spaces in a personalized way. Several techniques have been investigated for the development of RS. One of them is evolutionary computational (EC) techniques, which is an emerging trend with various application areas. The increasing interest in using EC for web personalization, information retrieval and RS fostered the publication of survey papers on the subject. However, these surveys have analyzed only a small number of publications, around ten. This study provides a comprehensive review of more than 65 research publications focusing on five aspects we consider relevant for such: the recommendation technique used, the datasets and the evaluation methods adopted in their experimental parts, the baselines employed in the experimental comparison of proposed approaches and the reproducibility of the reported experiments. At the end of this review, we discuss negative and positive aspects of these papers, as well as point out opportunities, challenges and possible future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the most comprehensive review of various approaches using EC in RS. Thus, we believe this review will be a relevant material for researchers interested in EC and RS.

AB Manufacturing processes are among the most energy intensive on earth. As negative ecological and economic impacts increase, reducing energy consumption is becoming critically important. In this article, a comprehensive overview of energy-saving strategies and opportunities for increasing energy efficiency in manufacturing operations is presented, with a focus on metal cutting processes. The issues and approaches involved in energy efficiency of machine tools and machining operations are reported in the literature and a structured research methodology is proposed for this purpose including prediction and modelling of machine energy consumption, determining the relationship between process energy consumption and process variables for material removal processes and optimization of cutting parameters in order to reduce energy consumption. Numerous techniques for increasing energy efficiency in manufacturing processes are identified and summarized, strengths and weaknesses of previous studies are discussed and potential avenues for future research are suggested.

AB Optimization of heat exchanger network (HEN) has traditionally been driven by economic objectives. Notwithstanding the importance of minimizing the total annual cost (TAC) of HEN, it is also important to ensure reliability. In order to obtain economical HEN considering system reliability simultaneously, a multi-objective optimization formulation of economic and system reliability is proposed in the design of HEN. A stage-wise superstructure is used to obtain feasible HEN, and the system reliability based on the number of heat exchangers in maximum irrelevant sub-network of HEN and the TAC are calculated as two objective functions. Then the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is applied to solve the multi-objective optimization mixed integer nonlinear programming model. Three case studies from literatures are used to assess the applicability and performance of the optimization formulation and solution algorithm. The system reliability is enhanced with TAC closes to the reported minimum, which is more meaningful than those obtained using single-objective optimization. The optimal solution set can aid in the selection of a safe and cost-effective network configuration for industrial plants and the proposed approach can easily be applied to include other objectives (e.g., sustainability and safety).

AB Energy, exergy and exergoeconomic analysis are carried out for single- and two-stage thermoelectric devices which can be used for either heating or cooling implementation. Coefficient of performance, exergetic efficiency and unit cost of heating/cooling power are investigated as the main target of energy, exergy and exergoeconomic analysis, respectively. A comprehensive comparison between single- and two-stage thermoelectric performances has outlined in different values of current and temperature difference between hot and cold sides. An effective range of current is defined for energy (COP > 0.5 x COPmax), exergy (epsilon > 0.5 x epsilon(max)) and exergoeconomic (c(c/H) < 2 x c(c/H,min)) analysis. Thermodynamic analysis results reveal that the maximized energy and exergy efficiency of two-stage thermoelectric is higher in comparison to the single-stage thermoelectric for both heating and cooling modes. Also, based on exergoeconomic results, minimum unit cost of single-stage thermoelectric product is less than that of two-stage thermoelectric for all temperature differences and effective range of current is more widespread for the case of single-stage thermoelectric. Obtained results reveal that the minimum unit cost of cooling power for single- and two-stage cooler is 3.967 and 16.22 $/kW h, respectively, for temperature difference of 10 K.

AB Recent technological developments have made it possible to generate power and cooling using the Kalina cycle (KC) through low grade heat sources utilization. The Kalina cooling-power cycle (KPCC) and Kalina LiBr-H2O absorption chiller cycle (KLACC) are two novel cases that have been proposed and analyzed with regard to their energetic and economic aspects. These systems combine the KC with NH3-H2O and LiBr-H2O absorption chillers, respectively. Having obtained the energy analysis results, exergy analysis is performed to analyze and compare the systems. A comparative exergoeconomic assessment is performed to obtain the unit cost of power-cooling generation. The exergetic analysis demonstrated total exergy destruction of KLACC is 40% higher than KPCC where major exergy destruction occurs in both condenser and second flash tank preheater. The KLACC exergetic efficiency is almost same as the KC although it is higher for KPCC system by 6.8%. According to the exergoeconomic analysis, the unit cost of power-cooling generation for KPCC is 20.5% lower than KLACC; therefore, KPCC performance is better than KLACC. The significant exergy destruction locations to optimize the system performance are the absorber in KPCC and second condenser in KLACC. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper deals with a thermoeconomic analysis of a new combination of ammonia/water power generation cycle and Turbine-Modular Helium Reactor (GT-MHR) cycle and liquefied natural gas (LNG) cryogenic exergy. In the proposed power generation system, the GT-MHR waste heat is considered as heat source as well as cryogenic exergy of LNG as thermal sink. Parametric study is performed to investigate the effects of key parameters. Also, a comparative study is conducted for proposed system with the same combined cycle without LNG cryogenic exergy. The results show that minimum temperature difference in the evaporator, Delta T-Ev, has the greatest effect on the energy and exergy efficiencies as well as total cost rate in comparison to other key parameters. For the proposed system, an increase in Delta T-Ev from 20 K to 30 K, leads to a reduction of 2.8% and 3.4%in both energy and exergy efficiencies and total cost rate, respectively. The results also show that the temperature and pressure of ammonia/water solution exiting the evaporator have the negligible effects on energy and exergy efficiencies. Also, ammonia concentration of solution entering the separator, has the greatest effect on the product cost. Moreover, a multi-objective optimization is performed to obtain optimal values of design parameters. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sparse signal reconstruction can be regarded as a problem of locating the nonzero entries of the signal. In presence of measurement noise, conventional methods such as l(1) norm relaxation methods and greedy algorithms, have shown their weakness in finding the nonzero entries accurately. In order to reduce the impact of noise and better locate the nonzero entries, in this paper, we propose a two-phase algorithm which works in a coarse-to-fine manner. In phase 1, a decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is applied to generate a group of robust solutions by optimizing l1 norm of the solutions. To remove the interruption of noise, the statistical features with respect to each entry among these solutions are extracted and an initial set of nonzero entries are determined by clustering technique. In phase 2, a forward-based selection method is proposed to further update this set and locate the nonzero entries more precisely based on these features. At last, the magnitudes of the reconstructed signal are obtained by the method of least squares. We conduct the comparison of our proposed method with several state-of-the-art compressive sensing recover methods, the best result in phase 1 and the approach combining phases 1 and 2 without the statistical features. Experimental results on benchmark signals as well as randomly generated signals demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the above methods, achieving higher recover precision and maintaining larger sparsity.

AB A novel multiobjective technique is proposed for solving constrained optimization problems (COPs) in this paper. The method highlights three different perspectives: 1) a COP is converted into an equivalent dynamic constrained multiobjective optimization problem (DCMOP) with three objectives: a) the original objective; b) a constraint-violation objective; and c) a niche-count objective; 2) a method of gradually reducing the constraint boundary aims to handle the constraint difficulty; and 3) a method of gradually reducing the niche size aims to handle the multimodal difficulty. A general framework of the design of dynamic constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms is proposed for solving DCMOPs. Three popular types of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, i.e., Pareto ranking-based, decomposition-based, and hype-volume indicator-based, are employed to instantiate the framework. The three instantiations are tested on two benchmark suites. Experimental results show that they perform better than or competitive to a set of state-of-the-art constraint optimizers, especially on problems with a large number of dimensions.

AB Most existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms experience difficulties in solving many-objective optimization problems due to their incapability to balance convergence and diversity in the high-dimensional objective space. In this paper, we propose a novel many-objective evolutionary algorithm using a one-by-one selection strategy. The main idea is that in the environmental selection, offspring individuals are selected one by one based on a computationally efficient convergence indicator to increase the selection pressure toward the Pareto optimal front. In the one-by-one selection, once an individual is selected, its neighbors are de-emphasized using a niche technique to guarantee the diversity of the population, in which the similarity between individuals is evaluated by means of a distribution indicator. In addition, different methods for calculating the convergence indicator are examined and an angle-based similarity measure is adopted for effective evaluations of the distribution of solutions in the high-dimensional objective space. Moreover, corner solutions are utilized to enhance the spread of the solutions and to deal with scaled optimization problems. The proposed algorithm is empirically compared with eight state-of-the-art many-objective evolutionary algorithms on 80 instances of 16 benchmark problems. The comparative results demonstrate that the overall performance of the proposed algorithm is superior to the compared algorithms on the optimization problems studied in this paper.

AB Designing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) for community detection in complex networks has attracted much attention of researchers recently. However, most of the existing methods focus on addressing the task of nonover-lapping community detection, where each node must belong to one and only one community. In fact, communities are often overlapped with each other in many real-world networks, thus it is necessary to design overlapping community detection algorithms. To this end, this paper proposes a mixed representation-based MOEA (MR-MOEA) for overlapping community detection. In MR-MOEA, a mixed individual representation scheme is proposed to fast encode and decode the overlapping divisions of complex networks. Specifically, this mixed representation consists of two parts: one represents all potential overlapping nodes and the other delegates all nonoverlapping nodes. These two parts evolve together to detect the overlapping communities of networks based on different updating strategies suggested in MR-MOEA. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm MR-MOEA on ten real-world complex networks and the experimental results demonstrate that MR-MOEA is superior over six representative algorithms for overlapping community detection.

AB Multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithms have attracted much attention for their promising performance in solving multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). In this paper, an adaptive MOPSO (AMOPSO) algorithm, based on a hybrid framework of the solution distribution entropy and population spacing (SP) information, is developed to improve the search performance in terms of convergent speed and precision. First, an adaptive global best (gBest) selection mechanism, based on the solution distribution entropy, is introduced to analyze the evolutionary tendency and balance the diversity and convergence of nondominated solutions in the archive. Second, an adaptive flight parameter adjustment mechanism, using the population SP information, is proposed to obtain the distribution of particles with suitable diversity and convergence, which can balance the global exploration and local exploitation abilities of the particles. Third, based on the gBest selection mechanism and the adaptive flight parameter mechanism, this proposed AMOPSO algorithm not only has high accuracy, but also attain a set of optimal solutions with better diversity. Finally, the performance of the proposed AMOPSO algorithm is validated and compared with other five state-of-the-art algorithms on a number of benchmark problems and water distribution system. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed AMOPSO algorithm, as well as demonstrate that AMOPSO outperforms other MOPSO algorithms in solving MOPs.

AB The selection of swarm leaders (i.e., the personal best and global best), is important in the design of a multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm. Such leaders are expected to effectively guide the swarm to approach the true Pareto optimal front. In this paper, we present a novel external archive-guided MOPSO algorithm (AgMOPSO), where the leaders for velocity update are all selected from the external archive. In our algorithm, multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) are transformed into a set of subproblems using a decomposition approach, and then each particle is assigned accordingly to optimize each subproblem. A novel archive-guided velocity update method is designed to guide the swarm for exploration, and the external archive is also evolved using an immune-based evolutionary strategy. These proposed approaches speed up the convergence of AgMOPSO. The experimental results fully demonstrate the superiority of our proposed AgMOPSO in solving most of the test problems adopted, in terms of two commonly used performance measures. Moreover, the effectiveness of our proposed archive-guided velocity update method and immune-based evolutionary strategy is also experimentally validated on more than 30 test MOPs.

AB Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) decomposes a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) into a number of scalar optimization subproblems and then solves them in parallel. In many MOEA/D variants, each subproblem is associated with one and only one solution. An underlying assumption is that each subproblem has a different Pareto-optimal solution, which may not be held, for irregular Pareto fronts (PFs), e.g., disconnected and degenerate ones. In this paper, we propose a new variant of MOEA/D with sorting-and-selection (MOEA/D-SAS). Different from other selection schemes, the balance between convergence and diversity is achieved by two distinctive components, decomposition-basedsorting (DBS) and angle-based-selection (ABS). DBS only sorts L closest solutions to each subproblem to control the convergence and reduce the computational cost. The parameter L has been made adaptive based on the evolutionary process. ABS takes use of angle information between solutions in the objective space to maintain a more fine-grained diversity. In MOEA/D-SAS, different solutions can be associated with the same subproblems; and some subproblems are allowed to have no associated solution, more flexible to MOPs or many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs) with different shapes of PFs. Comprehensive experimental studies have shown that MOEA/D-SAS outperforms other approaches; and is especially effective on MOPs or MaOPs with irregular PFs. Moreover, the computational efficiency of DBS and the effects of ABS in MOEA/D-SAS are also investigated and discussed in detail.

AB Nondominated sorting (NDS), which divides a population into several nondomination levels (NDLs), is a basic step in many evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms. It has been widely studied in a generational evolution model, where the environmental selection is performed after generating a whole population of offspring. However, in a steady-state evolution model, where a population is updated right after the generation of a new candidate, the NDS can be extremely time consuming. This is especially severe when the number of objectives and population size become large. In this paper, we propose an efficient NDL update method to reduce the cost for maintaining the NDL structure in steady-state EMO. Instead of performing the NDS from scratch, our method only updates the NDLs of a limited number of solutions by extracting the knowledge from the current NDL structure. Notice that our NDL update method is performed twice at each iteration. One is after the reproduction, the other is after the environmental selection. Extensive experiments fully demonstrate that, comparing to the other five state-of-the-art NDS methods, our proposed method avoids a significant amount of unnecessary comparisons, not only in the synthetic data sets, but also in some real optimization scenarios. Last but not least, we find that our proposed method is also useful for the generational evolution model.

AB Continuous berth allocation problem (BAPC) is a major optimization problem in transportation engineering. It mainly aims at minimizing the port stay time of ships by optimally scheduling ships to the berthing areas along quays while satisfying several practical constraints. Most of the previous literatures handle the BAPC by heuristics with different constraint handling strategies as it is proved NP-hard. In this paper, we transform the constrained single-objective BAPC (SBAPC) model into unconstrained multiobjective BAPC (MBAPC) model by converting the constraint violation as another objective, which is known as the multiobjective optimization (MOO) constraint handling technique. Then a bias selection modified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (MNSGA-II) is proposed to optimize the MBAPC, in which an archive is designed as an efficient complementary mechanism to provide search bias toward the feasible solution. Finally, the proposed MBAPC model and the MNSGA-II approach are tested on instances from literature and generation. We compared the results obtained by MNSGA-II with other MOO algorithms under the MBAPC model and the results obtained by single-objective oriented methods under the SBAPC model. The comparison shows the feasibility of the MBAPC model and the advantages of the MNSGA-II algorithm.

AB It is well known that the performances of evolutionary algorithms are influenced by the quality of their initial populations. Over the years, many different techniques for generating an initial population by uniformly covering as much of the search space as possible have been proposed. However, none of these approaches considers any input from the function that must be evolved using that population. In this paper, a new initialization technique, which can be considered a heuristic space-filling approach, based on both function to be optimized and search space, is proposed. It was tested on two well-known unconstrained sets of benchmark problems using several computational intelligence algorithms. The results obtained reflected its benefits as the performances of all these algorithms were significantly improved compared with those of the same algorithms with currently available initialization techniques. The new technique also proved its capability to provide useful information about the function's behavior and, for some test problems, the initial population produced high-quality solutions. This method was also tested on a few multiobjective problems, with the results demonstrating its benefits.

AB The mixing process plays a very important role in the engineering realization of the scramjet engine, and sufficient mixing between the incoming supersonic air and the fuel relates to improve the overall performance of the airbreathing hypersonic propulsion system. In the current study, the delta wing is placed in front of the injector to promote the mixing of fuel and supersonic crossflow, and the effects of the delta wing height and the jet-to-crossflow pressure ratio have been investigated numerically based on grid independency analysis and code validation. The obtained results predicted by the threedimensional Reynolds-average Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations coupled with the two equation k-omega shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model show that the delta wing has a highly remarkable improvement on mixing characteristics such as mixing efficiency and fuel penetration depth. However, the delta wing also shows additional losses of stagnation pressure. In the case of higher values of delta wing height and jet-to-crossflow pressure ratio, higher penetration and more losses of stagnation pressure are shown. At the same time, the mixing efficiency decreases with the increase of the jet-to-crossflow pressure ratio irrespective of the height of the delta wing, and there is an optimum height of the delta wing for each jet-to-crossflow pressure ratio to achieve the maximization of rapid fuel-air mixing. In addition, the hydrogen content in the recirculation region between the orifice and the delta wing is a result of both the jet-to-crossflow pressure ratio and the height of the delta wing. In conclusion, the design of the flow field with the delta wing to realize objective comprehensive optimal performance is a multi-objective problem, and it should be solved by the multi-objective design optimization approach.

   algorithms (MOGAs); Time slot allocation
AB Because of the increasing size and amount of vessels, it is important to efficiently manage vessel scheduling in ports. This study aims to assess the effects of channel and berth resources on the operation efficiency of ports using a multiobjective vessel scheduling optimization model. Using the minimum total scheduling time and the waiting time of the vessels as input, the model is for a one-way channel considering the safety, efficiency, and fairness of the scheduling. To solve the scheduling problem, the multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) was used. A scheduling trial for 20 vessels at certain peak hours at a port is simulated. The MOGA simulation obtained eight Pareto optimal solutions, which are vessel scheduling schemes. Compared with the first-come, first-served (FCFS) scheduling method, the capacity conversion times of vessels inbound and outbound can be reduced ninefold, and the total scheduling time can be reduced by more than 40%.

AB In China, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is recognized as one of the most promising technologies through which to achieve a large reduction in CO2 emissions in future. The choice among different CCS technologies is critical for large-scale applications. With the aim of developing instructive policy suggestions for CCS development, this study proposed an interval programming model to select the optimal CCS technology among the different CCS technologies available in China. The analysis results indicate that the selection of CO2 capture technologies should be based on the actual situation of the project and industry being targeted. If the government implements mandatory CO2 emission reductions, storage in deep saline aquifers is the optimal choice for CO2 sequestration when oil prices are low and the number of available CO2 emission permits is large. In contrast, enhanced oil recovery is the optimal choice when oil prices increase and the availability of CO2 emission permits decreases. It is critical that the government reduce the operating cost and the cost of CO2 capture in particular.

AB This paper aims to understand and optimize the crush response of Functionally Graded Thickness (FGT) tubes with various thickness distributions subjected to oblique loading using multi-objective optimization method. Hence, finite element (FE) models are established and their results are validated by experimental tests. Two objective functions (specific energy absorption and peak load) are approximated by four different multi-objective optimization models: the weighted average, multi-design optimization (MDO) technique, constrained single-objective optimization, and geometrical average methods. The optimum design results demonstrate that the selection of appropriate inversion tube parameters such as the die radius, the coefficient of friction between the die and tube, and thickness distribution function have significant roles in the crashworthiness design. The results give new ideas to improve the crashworthiness performance of inversion tubes under oblique loading conditions.

AB I rehearse two issues around the commentary of Whigham and colleagues. (1) There really are many more reasons than those given as to why natural evolution cannot reasonably find or select the 'optimal' individual. (2) A series of experimental molecular biology programmes, known generically as directed evolution, can use operators and selection schemes that natural evolution cannot. When developed further using the methods of synthetic biology, there are no operators or schemes for in silico evolution that cannot be applied precisely to directed evolution. The issues raised apply only to natural evolution but not to directed evolution.

AB Several current implementations of quantum circuits rely on the linear nearest neighbor restriction, which only allows interaction between adjacent qubits. Most methods that address the process of converting a generic circuit to an equivalent circuit which satisfies this restriction, minimize the number of additional SWAP gates required by this process. Moreover, most methods which address this problem are designed for 1D circuits. Considering the new and promising proposals for 2D quantum circuits, what we propose is a new perspective on this problem, namely that it can be seen as a multiobjective optimization problem. To test our hypothesis, we developed a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm that solves this problem by considering two objectives: minimizing the size of the 2D grid where the circuit is placed, and minimizing the number of additional SWAP gates. Of the methods designed for 2D circuits, only one considers different grid sizes which are much larger than strictly necessary. Consequently, our algorithm makes considerations which other methods do not make, since it naturally finds the grid which requires fewer SWAP gates for the circuit conversion, whether it is one-dimensional or two-dimensional. Our experimental results indicate that allowing a larger grid size results in fewer additional SWAP gates in about 73% of the tested circuits. Additionally, the average improvement we found when using larger grid sizes is about 30%, while the best improvement over using the smallest possible grid is 63.8%.

AB This paper proposes the Participatory Framework for Assessment and Improvement of Tools (ParFAIT) as a way to address low uptake of Water Resources Systems Optimization (WRSO) tools. ParFAIT is a transdisciplinary process conducted in five stages, two of which are participatory modeling (PM) exercises. Herein we describe the framework, introduce our candidate tool- Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA)-assisted optimization, and present the results of our first PM workshop. MOEA-assisted optimization has been put forth as a planning and decision making aid for utilities facing a large number of decisions and highly uncertain futures. The PM workshop, designed to solicit input on a tool testbed, was held in February 2015 with representatives from six Front Range, Colorado, water utilities. Our results include an expanded characterization of the decision making landscape, feedback on water utility decisions and performance goals commonly employed in WRSO studies, and new questions that warrant future investigation by researchers.

AB The article presents an efficient methodology based-on water cycle algorithm (WCA) to solve single and multiple objectives of economic load dispatch (ELD) aiming to generate the optimal value of the active generated power for each unit. Three objectives are adopted for optimisation either sequentially or concurrently; they are: (i) fuel cost considering valve-ripple effect, (ii) emission rate, and (iii) total network loss. The generating unit prohibited zones along with ramp rate limits and generating unit power limits specify the inequality constraints of the problem while maintaining system power balance. Usually, optimisation of simultaneous multiple objectives produces set of non-dominated Pareto-front solutions. To help the decision maker, the best compromise solution is carefully picked among optimal Pareto-front points. The proposed WCA-based methodology is demonstrated on three test cases with various complexities and under number of objective scenarios. Numerical results and further subsequent comparisons to other challenging optimisers indicate the viability and confirm the strength of the proposed WCA-based ELD method. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB A surrogate-assisted (SA) evolutionary algorithm for Multiobjective Optimization Problems (MOOPs) is presented as a contribution to Soft Computing (SC) in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Such algorithm is grounded on the cooperation between a pure evolutionary algorithm and a Kriging based algorithm featuring the Expected Hyper-Volume Improvement (EHVI) metric. Comparison with state-of-art pure and Kriging-assisted algorithms over two- and three-objective test functions have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can achieve high performance in the approximation of the Pareto-optimal front mitigating the drawbacks of its parent algorithms.

AB Artificial neural network model is developed for the prediction of phase transformation of steel from austenite, and thus construction of the continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagram. The model for prediction of transformation temperatures from steel composition is developed using data from published CCT diagrams. The trained network sometimes fails to predict the sequence of the phase transformation, contradicting the fundamentals of metallurgy. To avoid such limitations of data driven models and to make the models truthful and reasonable from metallurgical standpoint, prior knowledge is incorporated using genetic algorithm, through modifying the weights and biases of a trained neural network. The conventionally backpropagated multi-layered perceptron is modified from error minimization as well as knowledge incorporation point of view through formulation of the problem in both single and multi-objective optimization domains. The predictions of six transformation temperatures by the new models are found to be significantly better than the conventionally trained model. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The increase in the consumption of resources in the past decade has caused an increase in the interest of the international academic community in the challenges to reduce such rapid consumption of resources. Every year, many researchers propose different methods by which resource consumption can be reduced. Material, equipment, and process refinement are vivid examples of such efforts. While these innovations can be very helpful, in several cases, however, they can be very costly and greatly time-consuming. In addition, decision-makers tend to tackle the problem of resource consumption, while maintaining the proper level of service. Thus, in this paper, we propose a new bi-objective mathematical model by which we can reduce the consumption of resources and energy, as well as decrease the tardiness penalty in a supply chain scheduling and vehicle routing problem. The model demonstrates that finding the proper production (assembly) sequence, assignment of orders to vehicles and vehicle routing, will enable us to reduce resource consumption. A new Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm based on shaking and local search strategies of Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm is also developed to solve the proposed problem. Several criteria are introduced and defined to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm. Results demonstrate the out-performance of the proposed algorithm compared with the classic non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II. We also propose a method that allows decision makers to make an informed decision to choose a proper sequence of jobs and routes that create a trade-off between resource consumption and the tardiness penalty.

AB Transmission stability and reliability are important metrics in wireless sensor networks which brings great challenges to the study and application. Coverage issue has great relationship with reliable packets transmission which lays foundation for improving the performance of fault tolerance due to characteristics of network itself and working scenario. Immune mechanism based multipath decoupling connectivity algorithm with fault tolerance under coverage optimization (IM2DCA) is presented which includes maximum immune coverage algorithm (MICA) and immune multipath of parallel decoupling algorithm (IMPDA). MICA adopts the immune mechanism to optimize the nodes deployment and gets the maximum coverage laying the foundation for multipath establishment in the network scenario deployed with static and mobile sensor nodes. IMPDA adopts the immune mechanism to establish multiple paths from the source node to the destination node to improve the reliable transmission. Nodes decoupling is presented in the process of multipath establishment to lower the coupling degree of multipath joint model. It tries to make the joint model become the disjoint model or partly joint multipaths by lowering the importance degree of joint nodes to improve the performance of fault tolerance when fault nodes exist. Performance is analyzed through the established mathematical model in which transmission robustness and fault tolerance are analyzed. Simulation shows that the proposed IM2DCA can get the optimal network coverage with the conditional constraint. Under this scenario of optimized coverage, fault tolerance and effectiveness are proved through the optimization of multiple decoupled paths from the source node to the destination node based on the immune mechanism. IM2DCA improves the stability and reliability of wireless sensor networks via comparing it with representative works. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel combination of a multimode project scheduling problem with material ordering, in which material procurements are exposed to the total quantity discount policy is investigated in this paper. The study aims at finding an optimal Pareto frontier for a triple objective model derived for the problem. While the first objective minimizes the makespan of the project, the second objective maximizes the robustness of the project schedule and finally the third objective minimizes the total costs pertaining to renewable and nonrenewable resources involved in a project. Four well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms including non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII), strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm II (SPEAII), multi objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), and multi objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEAD) solve the developed triple-objective problem. The parameters of algorithms are tuned by the response surface methodology. The algorithms are carried out on a set of benchmarks and are compared based on five performance metrics evaluating their efficiencies in terms of closeness to the optimal frontier, diversity, and variance of results. Finally, a statistical assessment is conducted to analyze the results obtained by the algorithms. Results show that the NSGAII considerably outperforms others in 4 out of 5 metrics and the MOPSO performs better in terms of the remaining metric. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Emergency supplies pre-positioning is crucial to improve the speed of response and mitigate the effects of disasters. According to the requirements of emergency preparedness for both civilian and military operations in China, the paper presents a problem of integrated civilianmilitary emergency supplies pre-positioning, the aim of which is to maximize both the expected military operational efficiency and the expected civilian operational efficiency while minimizing the overall cost of pre-positioning. To solve the problem, the paper proposes a solution method that uses a multiobjective algorithm to evolve a population of main location solutions and uses another single-objective algorithm to search optimal allocation sub-solutions for each main solution. Among different heuristics, we select water wave optimization (WWO) to design a multiobjective algorithm for the main problem and select biogeography-based optimization (BBO) for the subproblem, and demonstrate that they have competitive performance advantage in comparison with a set of well-known algorithms.

AB In this paper, the behavior of the perturbation map is analyzed quantitatively by virtue of contingent derivatives and generalized contingent epiderivatives for the set-valued maps under strictly minimal efficiency. The purpose of this paper is to provide some well-known results concerning sensitivity analysis by applying a separation theorem for convex sets. When the results regress to multiobjective optimization, some related conclusions are obtained in a multiobjective programming problem.

AB In this paper, we solve a discrete bilevel problem with multiple objectives at the lower level and constraints at the upper level coupling variables of both levels. In the case of a multiobjective lower level, we deal with a set of Pareto-efficient solutions rather than a single optimal lower level solution. To calculate the upper level objective function value, we need to select one solution out of a potentially large set of efficient lower level solutions. To avoid the enumeration of the whole set of Pareto solutions, we formulate an auxiliary mixed integer linear programming problem with a large number of constraints. We propose an iterative exact method to solve it. To find a near-optimal upper level solution, we apply a metaheuristic. The method is tested on the discrete (r vertical bar p)-centroid problem with multiple objectives at the lower level.

AB Steel production is a main water consumer, energy consumer, and a major source of air pollution in China. To mitigate the steel industry's environmental pressures, the government is promoting several water-saving, energy saving, and emission-reduction technologies. This study developed a technology-based approach to investigate the water, energy and emission nexus (WEEN) of the steel industry. The results indicate that 4.1 m(3) of water use and 21.4 kWh of electricity use were related with the WEEN per ton of crude steel production in 2014, which accounted for around 66% of the total water use and 7% of electricity consumption of steel production, respectively. Of the WEEN water consumption, 66% and 34% was for cooling and emission control, respectively; 96% of the WEEN electricity consumption was for emission control. The water-energy-SO2 nexus was more intensive in the coking and sintering processes, whereas the water-energy-dust nexus was more intensive in the steel-making process. Diffusion of advanced technology and improved raw material quality can reduce existing SO2 and NOx emissions by 57% and 25%, although at the expense of 5%, 56%, 0.2%, and 40% increases of dust emissions, water consumption, energy consumption, and costs, respectively. Technology sets identified by the Pareto optimization method can reduce the SO2, NOx and dust emissions by 97%, 50%, and 75%, respectively, and water and energy consumption can be reduced by 10% and 2%, respectively; however, costs could increase by 51-74%. This study highlights the need and opportunities for integrating emissions and resource use in nexus studies and production planning.

AB Over the past several decades, a noticeable amount of research efforts has been directed to minimising injuries and death to people inside a structure that is subjected to an impact loading.
   Thin-walled (TW) tubular components have been widely employed in energy absorbing structures to alleviate the detrimental effects of an impact loading during a collision event and thus enhance the crashworthiness performance of a structure.
   Comprehensive knowledge of the material properties and the structural behaviour of various TW components under various loading conditions is essential for designing an effective energy absorbing system.
   In this paper, based on a broad survey of the literature, a comprehensive overview of the recent developments in the area of crashworthiness performance of TW tubes is given with a special focus on the topics that emerged in the last ten years such as crashworthiness optimisation design and energy absorbing responses of unconventional TW components including multi-cells tubes, functionally graded thickness tubes and functionally graded foam filled tubes.
   Due to the huge number of studies that analysed and assessed the energy absorption behaviour of various TW components, this paper presents only a review of the crashworthiness behaviour of the components that can be used in vehicles structures including hollow and foam-filled TW tubes under lateral, axial, oblique and bending loading.

AB This paper exhibits a test examination and investigation on the impacts of Wire Electro Discharge Cutting (WEDC) parameter on cutting time and surface roughness (R-a) of Inconel 800. Four cutting parameters, pulse-on time, pulse-off time, pulsed current and servo voltage have been selected to study their effects on cutting time and surface roughness (R-a). The response variables like cutting time and surface roughness (R-a) are then analysed using response surface methodology (RSM). The general belief that increase in pulse-on time reduces cutting time has been revisited. It has been seen, here, that cutting time diminishes with the expansion of pulse-on time obviously up to the limit and from there on again increments. The surface roughness, on the other hand, increases with the increase in pulse-on time appreciably. It is for the most part seen that when the rate of machining is moderate, i.e. it requires longer investment to machine then the surface completion is superior to that acquired while machining at a quicker rate. But, as increased machining time leads to an increase in the manufacturing cost, a trade-off between cutting time and surface roughness, was successfully made by utilising a hybrid PCA-grey relational analysis (GRA). This gave the best combination of cutting parameters. Also hybrid GRA-PCA shows less percentage error compare to traditional GRA. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To maintain a competitive edge, technology manufacturers must produce systems that are reliable enough to satisfy customers yet cheap enough to engineer so that they are profitable. This paper presents an optimization model to maximize the statistical confidence in product profitability, permitting flexibility in the design and number of the units manufactured. This is unlike traditional approaches, which focus on the two cases that optimize the reliability of a single unit or the s-expected profit obtained from a very large number of units. These two extremes disregard a practical concern, namely the negative impact that a larger than s-expected number of failures will exert on product profitability. This paper formulates an optimization problem to mitigate this risk. Virtually all reliability optimization problems also assume that component failures are s-independent. The present paper does not impose this assumption. The utility of the approach is demonstrated through a series of examples which compare the reliability of systems designed with and without the assumption of s-correlated component failures. The results indicate that explicitly considering s-correlation consistently mitigates the risk to profitability more effectively than the same method when component failures are assumed to be s independent.

AB Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) have become the promising energy source for stationary and portable applications. The design of SOFCs including its structure and its operation are an important part to be properly optimized in order to achieve the best performance. The topic on optimization of SOFC has gained tremendous attention recently in line with the growing applications of fuel cell. This paper involves a literature survey of the application of SOFC in particular the optimization strategies. The strategies are reviewed in detail based on five features, which are the decision variable, objective analysis, constraint, method and tools. The future trends of research related to the optimization for SOFC are also discussed to provide better insight for future research work in this area.

AB Recently, riding through grid faults and supporting the grid voltage by using grid-connected converters (GCCs) have become major requirements reflected in the grid codes. This paper presents a novel reference current generation scheme with the ability to support the grid voltage by injecting a proper set of positive/negative active/reactive currents by using four controlling parameters. Analytical expressions are proposed to obtain the optimal values of these parameters under any grid voltage condition. The optimal performances can be obtained by achieving the following objectives: first, compliance with the phase voltage limits, second, maximized active and reactive power delivery, third, minimized fault currents, and fourth reduced oscillations on the active and reactive powers. These optimal behaviors bring significant advantages to emerging GCCs, such as increasing the efficiency, lowering the dc-link ripples, improving ac system stability, and avoiding equipment tripping. Simulation and experimental results verify the analytical results and the proposed expressions.

AB Pavements heavily influence the management costs in highway networks. Operating pavements represents a challenging task involving complex decisions on the application of maintenance actions to keep them at a reasonable level of performance. The major difficulty in applying computational tools to support decision making lies in a large number of pavement sections as a result of a high length of road networks. This paper addresses maintenance scheduling for pavements by consolidating this task into two stages. In each stage, multiobjective optimization is used to optimize maintenance schedules. The main motivation is to obtain a computationally treatable model for large road networks. The first stage is defined by a collection of pavement sections composing the road network. In this stage, the performance and maintenance models are addressed. These models account for uncertainties in the future performance and effects of maintenance by defining model parameters as random variables. The second stage refers to combining maintenance schedules for individual sections to determine the optimal maintenance plan at the network level. The results obtained for the real road network demonstrate the validity and usefulness of the proposed framework. Moreover, this framework is general and can be extended to different types of infrastructure assets.

AB This paper proposes an approach for developing optimal risk-based management strategies for bridges in coastal regions. Currently, bridge management strategies in these regions are designed to limit the negative effects corrosion has on bridge performance under traffic loads. However, recent large-scale hurricanes and their associated damage to bridges have demonstrated the need to consider hurricanes when making bridge management decisions. This paper aims to develop optimal risk-based management strategies that include both repair actions to address deteriorating performance under traffic loads and retrofit actions to minimize the potential for failure during hurricanes. The proposed approach considers the uncertainties associated with hazards, and the economic, social, and environmental consequences of failure under traffic loads and hurricanes. The optimal management strategies are achieved by formulating and solving a multiobjective optimization problem. The objectives of this optimization problem include minimizing the lifecycle costs accrued due to repair and retrofit actions and minimizing the maximum risk over the lifecycle of the bridge. The proposed risk-based approach is applied to a steel girder bridge located in a hurricane-prone region.

AB Managers of modern large-scale construction projects are under pressure to meet higher customer expectations with tighter budgets. Although they deal with numerous issues in the purchasing and manufacturing processes, selecting effective and efficient material suppliers is among the most critical one. This selection is often very challenging when lacking precise information. Moreover, the construction contractor and the suppliers often have conflicting interests and make decisions individually. As research concerning the aforementioned issues is still relatively scarce, this paper proposes a multiobjective bilevel programming model with random fuzzy coefficients for supplier selection problem with multiple items (SSP-MI) in a large-scale construction project. The upper level problem deals with the construction contractor who selects suppliers to minimize total cost, maximize service, and item quality. The lower level problem deals with the suppliers who allocate supplied items to maximize their own total profit. For solving this complex bilevel nonlinear model with uncertainties an expected value operator method is first used to deal with the uncertain variables, and then Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and a combinatorial algorithm with a sectional genetic algorithm with fuzzy logic controller (flc-SGA) and a weighted-sum method (WSM) based on satisfactory degree (SD) denoted as flc-SGA with SD-based WSM are proposed. Finally, the proposed approach is demonstrated to be effective when carried out in the Pubugou Hydropower construction project.

TI Method for Generating Multiple MRR Solutions for Application in

AB Cost-leveling models have been introduced recently to minimize the fluctuations in annual maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation (MRR) costs within a multiyear infrastructure asset-management plan. However, these models were found to produce limited results because they ignored the impacts on all the preceding/succeeding MRR activities in a multiyear plan when the initially identified implementation time of one MRR activity was adjusted for cost-leveling purposes. This paper proposes a method to generate multiple MRR solutions at the facility level for existing cost-leveling models at the network level. The method utilizes two concepts as follows: (1)the fast elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to generate a Pareto optimal set of feasible MRR alternatives, and (2)the pseudoweight vector approach with the Euclidean distance and a confidence interval to select multiple MRR solutions from the Pareto optimal set identified by NSGA-II. The proposed method is applied to a sample concrete bridge deck as a case study in this paper; the results show that the proposed method was able to provide multiple MRR solutions having various profiles in terms of the intervention times of the MRR activities and annual MRR costs. Consequently, the proposed method advances the theoretical framework of existing cost-leveling models by combining four approaches to provide multiple MRR solutions at the facility level: (1)NSGA-II algorithm, (2)pseudoweight vector approach, (3)Euclidean distance, and (4)a confidence interval. In addition, it is expected that the proposed method can be well applied to existing multiobjective optimization models to generate a set of nondominated good policies for infrastructure asset management.

AB A mathematical model of a fixed-bed reactor for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) over 37% Co/SiO2 catalyst was developed to investigate the performance of the whole process for products' selectivity and syngas conversion. The model was capable of calculating the changes of reactant and products' concentrations, partial pressures, conversion, and selectivity. In a previous study, a series of combined novel FT and water gas shift (WGS) reaction mechanisms (eight elementary FT reaction pathways along with seven WGS kinetics models) were developed in order to calibrate and validate the mathematical model along with reaction kinetics at different experimental conditions. Such mathematical models with reaction networks can be used as a key tool to emphasize the most significant facts of FTS catalysis and chemistry. Integration of the global search optimization algorithm with the developed model was explained for estimation of kinetics parameters. Data analyses were carried out to ensure that the predicted model results as well as kinetic parameters are significantly relevant and physically meaningful. Parametric studies were performed to numerically investigate the effects of operating conditions (e.g., reaction temperature, total pressure, space velocity, and H-2/CO molar ratio) on products' selectivity and reactant conversion. These parameters were then included in a multiobjective optimization in MATLAB using NSGA-II to optimize the CO2 and HC products' selectivity and syngas conversion. The optimization process gives rise to a set of trade-off optimal solutions (Pareto-optimal solutions) which is used as a dynamic database depending on the specific requirement. A different operating condition can be selected from such a database which privileges the optimization of a particular output (e.g., conversion and selectivity).

AB Structural design has an imperative role in deciding the failure possibility of a Reinforced Concrete (RC) structure. Recent research works achieved the goal of predicting the structural failure of the RC structure with the assistance of machine learning techniques. Previously, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been trained supported by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to classify RC structures with reasonable accuracy. Though, keeping in mind the sensitivity in predicting the structural failure, more accurate models are still absent in the context of Machine Learning. Since the efficiency of multiobjective optimization over single objective optimization techniques is well established. Thus, the motivation of the current work is to employ a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) to train the Neural Network (NN) based model. In the present work, the NN has been trained with MOGA to minimize the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Maximum Error (ME) toward optimizing the weight vector of the NN. The model has been tested by using a dataset consisting of 150 RC structure buildings. The proposed NN-MOGA based model has been compared with Multi-layer perceptron-feed-forward network (MLP-FFN) and NN-PSO based models in terms of several performance metrics. Experimental results suggested that the NN-MOGA has outperformed other existing well known classifiers with a reasonable improvement over them. Meanwhile, the proposed NN-MOGA achieved the superior accuracy of 93.33% and F-measure of 94.44%, which is superior to the other classifiers in the present study.

AB The optimum design of power system components is becoming a relevant topic in power system studies. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are considered as a proper approach for optimisation problems in which non-linear elements are involved. Several trends are presently leading GAs to a new level; for instance, its combination with parallel computing can facilitate the solution of problems where individual evaluations of the fitness function require an important computational effort. This study presents a procedure based on a MATLAB-EMTP application and the usage of a multicore environment for the optimum selection of hybrid high-voltage DC (HVDC) circuit breaker parameters; the goal is to obtain a transient response of the hybrid design with voltages, currents and fault clearance times within specified limits.

AB In the current study, an integrated renewable based energy system consisting of a solar flat plate collector is employed to generate electricity while providing cooling load and hydrogen. A parametric study is carried out in order to determine the main design parameters and their effects on the objective functions of the system. The outlet temperature of generator, inlet temperature to organic Rankine cycle turbine, solar irradiation intensity (I), collector mass flow rate (m(col)) and flat plate collector area (AF) are considered as five decision variables. The results of parametric study show that the variation of collector mass flow rate between 3 kg/s and 8 kg/s has different effects on exergy efficiency and total cost rate of the system. In addition, the result shows that increment of inlet temperature to the ORC evaporator has a negative effect on cooling capacity of the system. It can lead to a decrease the cooling capacity from 44.29 kW to 22.6 kW, while the electricity generation and hydrogen production rate of the system increase. Therefore, a multi objective optimization is performed in order to introduce the optimal design conditions based on an evolutionary genetic algorithm. Optimization results show that exergy efficiency of the system can be enhanced from 1.72% to 3.2% and simultaneously the cost of the system can increase from 19.59 $/h to 22.28 $/h in optimal states.

AB The lifespan of a battery in battery energy storage systems (BESSs) is affected by various factors such as the operating temperature of the battery, depth of discharge, and magnitudes of the charging/discharging currents supplied to or drawn from the battery. In this study, the optimal location and size of a BESS are found for voltage regulation in a distribution system while increasing the lifespan of the battery. Various factors that affect the lifespan of a battery are considered and modelled. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimisation problem with two-objective functions. The first objective function calculates the energy losses in the system, whereas the second objective function represents the total investment cost of the distributed generator (DG) and BESS installations. Wind and solar DGs with uncertainties in their output powers are also considered with the BESSs. An elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II with a utopian point method is used to solve the optimisation problem. Furthermore, an IEEE 906 bus European low-voltage test feeder and eight test cases are considered for this study. The results show reduced losses and cost, improvement in the voltage profile, and extended lifespan of the batteries.

TI Risk-cost optimization for procurement planning in multi-tier supply
   chain by Pareto Local Search with relaxed acceptance criterion
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH

DE Risk-cost optimization; Multi-tier supply chain; Pareto Local Search
ID MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; MANAGEMENT
AB We address a 2-objective optimization problem to minimize a retailer's procurement cost and risk that is evaluated as recovery time of the retailer's business after the procurement is suspended by a catastrophic event. In order to reduce the recovery time, the retailer needs to decentralize ordering to multiple suppliers and have contingency stock, which costs the retailer. In multi-tier supply chains, not only the retailer's procurement plan but also their suppliers' procurement plans affect the retailers' risk and cost. Due to the huge combinations of their plans, it is difficult to find Pareto optimal solutions of the 2-objective optimization problem within a short space of time. We apply Pareto Local Search (PLS) based on heuristics to generate neighbors of a solution by changing suppliers' plans in the closer tier to the retailer. The original PLS accepts the solutions that are nondominated neighbor solutions for the next search, but the acceptance criterion is too strict to find all Pareto optimal solutions. We relax the acceptance criterion in order to include dominated solutions whose Pareto rank is equal to or less than a threshold. The threshold is updated based on changes of Pareto rank during local searches. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The current situation, which is driven by environmental concerns and increased air traffic, forces airport operators to examine their energy systems in an integrated approach. In order to optimize total expenditures, demands of energy in all forms must be considered. This paper introduces a novel method for the optimal design of multi-modal energy systems, which will be put to further use in the European Union Horizon 2020 MODER project. The optimization problem was formulated as mixed-integer linear programming based on a superstructure approach, including all feasible state-of-the-art technologies. Part-load efficiencies as well as the influence of ambient conditions on available output capacities were considered. The model took into account several types of energy storages, i.e., electrochemical, thermal and water storages. For fifteen locations, the optimal set of technologies, their capacity and operation was identified. Results showed that for this load range, combined heat and power plants were economically very attractive. Furthermore, photovoltaic energy was a viable option, even without designated feed-in tariff. Last but not least, compression chillers with chilled water storages offered an attractive option for enhanced flexibility. Combined total cost savings by using both the described method and on-site generation of up to 61% were achieved. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Utilization of renewable energy based distributed generation such as wind turbine generation (WTG) provides proper opportunity for enhancement of the electric power distribution networks. However, appropriate integration of WTG in distribution networks is crucial for ensuring quality and reliability of power supply. This paper presents a novel and comprehensive solution methodology for optimum allocation of different WTG types. A nested programming based on imperialist competitive algorithm is used to minimize weighted sum of active power losses and system reliability indexes without violating the network constraints. The main optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming, while for accurate analysis of load curtailment, expected energy not supplied of the network is calculated by a set of nonlinear optimal power flow programming sub-problems. Four case studies are examined to demonstrate various aspects of the proposed approach using two 33-bus and 9 bus distribution networks. According to results, the case studies elaborate accuracy and validity of the proposed methodology that not only imply more precise results than conventional methods but also shows reliability evaluation satisfy technical constraints during different contingencies. This comprehensive methodology can be used as a suitable tool for different networks with various islanding rules. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over the last years there have been frequent changes to buildings' thermal legislation, to cope with increasing environmental restrictions and a wider consumer awareness. This work has a twofold objective: 1 provide an overall methodology to evaluate changes in buildings' thermal regulations; 2 to assess the economic merit of these regulatory changes, which have a profound economic impact especially on homeowners, tenants and the global urban real estate market, but also on the society through wider environmental impacts. The literature has provided several contributions at the scale of buildings, but few at the scale of cities (or even regions). This paper uses the city of Lisbon (Portugal) as a case study to test the methodology and determine the economic impact of the changes made in the thermal legislation by the Government. The economic assessment was made at 3 levels: financial analysis, economic analysis and social-economic analysis. It was found that the new regulation brings not only environmental benefits but also economic benefits in long term at both individual and social level. It was furthermore concluded that the impact of those benefits are geographically uneven, and old areas of the city with worse energy ratings have better economic indicators. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper first defines the concept of energy-driven urban design. It aims to reveal synergies and trade-offs that may arise while designing urban areas for better energy performance. To facilitate urban planners and designers tackle these problems at the early stage of their work, this paper proposes the idea of simulation-based urban form generation and optimization modeling. It connects parametric models of urban form generation to an optimization engine coupled with a widely available program of energy systems.
   To build up the model of simulation-based urban form generation and optimization modeling, this paper reviews the state-of-the-art of simulation-based design generation and optimization modeling and discusses its application on energy-driven urban design at the district scale. The paper compares the main generative methods and presents their limitations and advantages to aid energy-driven urban design. For the urban form generation modeling, the paper also reviews the most relevant approaches to urban morphology. These approaches help to define the urban elements for the urban form generation.
   Most of the existing design generation and optimization models are observed to consist of a workflow, a generative method, and a series of generation constraints. Based on this, the paper proposes a model of simulation-based urban form generation and optimization modeling for energy-driven urban design. The model consists of a workflow with three steps, a collection step, the generation step, and the optimization step. The constraints yet need to be defined. At the district scale, the model also has to work at an appropriate resolution and precision. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The performance and the exhaust emissions of a diesel engine operating on nano-diesel-biodiesel blended fuels has been investigated. Multi wall carbon nano tubes (CNT) (40, 80 and 120 ppm) and nano silver particles (40, 80 and 120 ppm) were produced and added as additive to the biodiesel-diesel blended fuel. Six cylinders, four-stroke diesel engine was fuelled with these new blended fuels and operated at different engine speeds. Experimental test results indicated the fact that adding nano particles to diesel and biodiesel fuels, increased diesel engine performance variables including engine power and torque output up to 2% and brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) was decreased 7.08% compared to the net diesel fuel. CO2 emission increased maximum 17.03% and CO emission in a biodiesel-diesel fuel with nano-particles was lower significantly (25.17%) compared to pure diesel fuel. UHC emission with silver nano-diesel-biodiesel blended fuel decreased (28.56%) while with fuels that contains CNT nano particles increased maximum 14.21%. With adding nano particles to the blended fuels, NOx increased 25.32% compared to the net diesel fuel. This study also presents genetic programming (GP) based model to predict the performance and emission parameters of a CI engine in terms of nano-fuels and engine speed. Experimental studies were completed to obtain training and testing data. The optimum models were selected according to statistical criteria of root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2). It was observed that the GP model can predict engine performance and emission parameters with correlation coefficient (R-2) in the range of 0.93-1 and RMSE was found to be near zero. The simulation results demonstrated that GP model is a good tool to predict the CI engine performance and emission parameters. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a lifetime reliability-based approach for the optimization of post-tensioned concrete box-girder bridges under corrosion attack. The proposed approach is illustrated by determining the optimal life-cycle cost and CO2 emissions of several initial designs of post-tensioned box-girder bridges with different objectives, i.e. the lowest initial costs, the longest corrosion initiation time, or the maximum safety. The study was conducted in two steps. Firstly, the Pareto set presents initial designs considering the cross-section geometry, the concrete strength, the reinforcing steel and the prestressing steel. Secondly, the maintenance optimization was conducted with the proposed method, aimed at minimizing the economic, environmental and societal impacts of the bridge while satisfying the reliability target during its life-span. Effective maintenance is, able to extend the service life of the bridge with the minimum cost and CO2 emissions. It is indicated that a durability-conscious initial design is particularly beneficial for life-cycle performance. Besides, the emphasis on the initial design can also have an effect on the life cycle performance of bridges. It is found that designs with longer corrosion initiation time are associated with lower life-cycle cost, especially when using concrete of higher strength. Findings from the current paper also indicate that optimal maintenance strategies are more likely to be those with fewer maintenance actions that repair all deteriorating structures simultaneously.

AB A CHP-HP integrated system coupled by combined heating and power system and heat pump has been proposed previously, but its performance varies with the design and operation strategies. This paper develops a multi-objective optimal model of the new integrated system based on the comprehensive indicators, i.e. primary energy saving ratio, CO2 emission reduction ratio and annual expense saving ratio. The key design parameters, such as the prime mover capacity (PM), the outlet temperature from heat pump and the decision value to run the PM, are optimized by genetic algorithm. In order to verify the multi-objective optimal model, a case analysis is presented. The results show that the comprehensive performance of 26.8% is the best when the PM capacity is selected as 1136 kW, the decision value is set as 0.6 and the outlet temperature from heat pump is set as 25. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is implemented to identify how the system performance changes regarding the variation of key design parameters. Finally, it is concluded that the multi-objective optimal model is very helpful for the optimization design and practical applications of the CHP-HP integrated system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent work has been devoted to study the use of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) in stock portfolio optimization, within a common mean-variance framework. This article proposes the use of a more appropriate framework, mean-semivariance framework, which takes into account only adverse return variations instead of overall variations. It also proposes the use and comparison of established technical analysis (TA) indicators in pursuing better outcomes within the risk-return relation. Results show there is some difference in the performance of the two selected MOEAs non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II) and strength pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 (SPEA 2) - within portfolio optimization. In addition, when used with four TA based strategies relative strength index (RSI), moving average convergence/divergence (MACD), contrarian bollinger bands (CBB) and bollinger bands (BB), the two selected MOEAs achieve solutions with interesting in-sample and out-of-sample outcomes for the BB strategy.

AB Automated parameter search methods are commonly used to optimize neuron models. A more challenging task is to fit models of neural systems since the model response is determined by both intrinsic properties of neurons and the neural wiring and architecture of the network. Neural records of cells in the visual system are often analyzed in terms of the cell's receptive field and its temporal response. This type of data requires a finer point-by-point comparison of response traces between the simulated output and the recorded data. To address these issues, we applied a genetic algorithm optimization in conjunction with a multiobjective fitness function and a population-based error metric. Two different models of the early stages in the visual system were fitted to electrophysiological recordings and results from a modeling study, respectively. The first one is a model of cone photoreceptors and horizontal cells that reproduces adaptation to the mean light intensity in the retina. A multiobjective fitness function based on the normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) and a shape error descriptor captures high-frequency oscillations in the impulse response to uniform white flashes. The second one is a large-scale model of the thalamocortical system that accounts for the slow rhythms observed during sleep. An error metric of the population neural activity is used in this case. We argue that the optimization framework proposed in this paper could serve as a useful tool for parameter fitting of neuron models and large-scale models in the visual system pathway.

TI Cooperative vehicles for robust traffic congestion reduction: An

   factors

ID MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION
AB Traffic congestion continues to be a persistent problem throughout the world. As vehicle-to-vehicle communication develops, there is an opportunity of using cooperation among close proximity vehicles to tackle the congestion problem. The intuition is that if vehicles could cooperate opportunistically when they come close enough to each other, they could, in effect, spread themselves out among alternative routes so that vehicles do not all jam up on the same roads. Our previous work proposed a decentralized multiagent based vehicular congestion management algorithm entitled Congestion Avoidance and Route Allocation using Virtual Agent Negotiation (CARAVAN), wherein the vehicles acting as intelligent agents perform cooperative route allocation using inter-vehicular communication. This paper focuses on evaluating the practical applicability of this approach by testing its robustness and performance (in terms of travel time reduction), across variations in: (a) environmental parameters such as road network topology and configuration; (b) algorithmic parameters such as vehicle agent preferences and route cost/preference multipliers; and (c) agent-related parameters such as equipped/non-equipped vehicles and compliant/non-compliant agents. Overall, the results demonstrate the adaptability and robustness of the decentralized cooperative vehicles approach to providing global travel time reduction using simple local coordination strategies.

AB In this study, the authors apply the multi-objective optimisation (MOO) methods to the challenge posed by joint rate maximisation and total transmission power (TTP) minimisation in cooperative cognitive radio networks. The proposed MOO methods which are based on amplify and forward relaying strategy optimise the two conflicting objectives and, at same time, they maximise the rate quality and minimise the TTP allocated to the network relays simultaneously. The MOO problem under investigation is a non-convex non-linear combinatorial optimisation one that three MOO methods are presented for a desired solution. The explored methods are: weighted sum algorithm (which is based on a simplistic model), MOO fractional programming method (which has much in common with their MOO problem) and lexicographic algorithm (which is suitably adapted to complex combinatorial optimisation environments due to its robustness in avoiding trapping in local optima). Their simulation results confirm the proposed methods' effectiveness for simultaneous rate maximisation and TTP minimisation as well as their superiority over counterpart algorithms.

AB In this study, an effective energy management system (EMS) for application in integrated building and microgrid system is introduced and implemented as a multi-objective optimisation problem. The proposed architecture covers different key modelling aspects such as distributed heat and electricity generation characteristics, heat transfer and thermal dynamics of sustainable residential buildings and load scheduling potentials of household appliances with associated constraints. Through various simulation studies under different working scenarios with real data, different system constraints and user's objectives, the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed model are studied and validated compared with the existing residential EMSs. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed EMS has the capability not only to conserve energy in sustainable homes and microgrid system and to reduce energy consumption costs accordingly, but also to satisfy user's comfort level through optimal scheduling and operation management of both demand and supply sides.

AB Large construction and infrastructure projects are a billion-dollar business, but few studies have addressed the integrated operations in this unique domain of the construction supply chain (CSC). The comparison between the CSC and a conventional supply chain enables us to examine its framework and establish a quantitative optimization model for the CSC. To introduce the integrated operations concept into the CSC, many uncertainties need to be first dealt with, for which a multiobjective uncertain optimization model is developed. As the optimization of the owner and fabricator's costs and the service level are the main objectives, a hybrid genetic algorithm with fuzzy-random method is developed to solve the optimization model. An integrated multiobjective purchasing and production planning model is then constructed and applied to a hydropower construction project in Southwest China. The results illustrate that efficient integrated operations are critical for the CSC performance. The optimization results also indicate that considering of uncertain rush orders and delay times can be vital for optimum CSC performance. With this proposed method, construction managers can quickly respond to changing uncertain demand. This paper has highlighted that project managers need to collaborate with other stakeholders to ensure optimal CSC performance.

AB In today's competitive environment, new turbomachinery designs need to be not only more efficient, quieter, and "greener" but also need to be developed at on much shorter time scales and at lower costs. A number of advanced optimization strategies have been developed to achieve these requirements. This paper reviews recent progress in turbomachinery design optimization to solve real-world aerodynamic problems, especially for compressors and turbines. This review covers the following topics that are important for optimizing turbomachinery designs. (1) optimization methods, (2) stochastic optimization combined with blade parameterization methods and the design of experiment methods, (3) gradient-based optimization methods for compressors and turbines and (4) data mining techniques for Pareto Fronts. We also present our own insights regarding the current research trends and the future optimization of turbomachinery designs.

AB The concept of sustainability in supply chain management refers to a logical balance between economic development, environmental considerations, and social responsibilities. In this paper, a sustainable model has been proposed to design a supply chain network in textile industries considering the key environmental and social factors. Regarding the type of industry and characteristics of the area under study (Zanjan, northwest Iran), minimizing the negative effects of wasteful extraction of ground waters and the environmental pollution resulting from industrial wastewaters and maximizing justice based employment were considered. The supply chain consists of the following elements: suppliers, plants, distribution centers, water refinery centers, and customer zones. One of the important features of the proposed model is that it considers the lost opportunity cost of facilities and focuses on wastewater recycling in water refineries. To solve the model, the Multi-Objective Vibration Damping Optimization (MOVDO) algorithm has been used. In addition, to evaluate the proposed model, as a case study, the supply chain network design problem was solved in textile industry. In addition, to evaluate the solution performance of the used algorithm in comparison with that of the NSGA-II algorithm, ten random problems with different sizes were solved, and the results were analyzed using different indexes. All in all, the results show that the proposed method has the necessary performance. (C) 2017 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved.

AB A method for the stochastic design of groundwater quality observation well network is presented. The method uses calibration-constrained Null-space Monte Carlo analysis for the stochastic simulation of the reduction ratio of peak concentration and the time corresponding to this in an injection well field. The numerical groundwater model simulations are constrained with a limited amount of field measurements. The objective of the monitoring network design is to identify optimal monitoring locations that allow for prediction of spatial fields from the data collected at limited number of points in the spatial domain. These locations need to be robust to different possible outcomes simulated using the stochastic model runs, and result in good spatial predictions, regardless of which one of the many possibilities turned out to be the true representation of nature. Multiple simulated fields of concentration and time are used to identify a small set of empirical orthogonal functions (spatial basis functions) for reduced-rank prediction of the spatial patterns in these two fields. The Differential Evolution algorithm was used to find the monitoring locations that allowed for optimal reconstruction of all the simulated fields (potential future states of reality) from the set of empirical orthogonal functions. The applicability is demonstrated for designing a monitoring network for an injection well field. Optimal locations of 10 monitoring wells were identified. The method has the capability to simultaneously identify the optimal locations and inform optimal times for monitoring reduction ratio of peak concentration. The method is flexible to iteratively combine stochastic modeling and monitoring for optimal groundwater management.

AB Managing water resources systems requires coordinated operation of system infrastructure to mitigate the impacts of hydrologic extremes while balancing conflicting multisectoral demands. Traditionally, recommended management strategies are derived by optimizing system operations under a single problem framing that is assumed to accurately represent the system objectives, tacitly ignoring the myriad of effects that could arise from simplifications and mathematical assumptions made when formulating the problem. This study illustrates the benefits of a rival framings framework in which analysts instead interrogate multiple competing hypotheses of how complex water management problems should be formulated. Analyzing rival framings helps discover unintended consequences resulting from inherent biases of alternative problem formulations. We illustrate this on the monsoonal Red River basin in Vietnam by optimizing operations of the system's four largest reservoirs under several different multiobjective problem framings. In each rival framing, we specify different quantitative representations of the system's objectives related to hydropower production, agricultural water supply, and flood protection of the capital city of Hanoi. We find that some formulations result in counterintuitive behavior. In particular, policies designed to minimize expected flood damages inadvertently increase the risk of catastrophic flood events in favor of hydropower production, while min-max objectives commonly used in robust optimization provide poor representations of system tradeoffs due to their instability. This study highlights the importance of carefully formulating and evaluating alternative mathematical abstractions of stakeholder objectives describing the multisectoral water demands and risks associated with hydrologic extremes.

   Matching
SO SPE JOURNAL

ID UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM; EVOLUTIONARY
AB Multiobjective history matching has gained popularity in the last decade. It provides an ensemble of diverse set and good matched models that should lead to improved forecasting. Moreover, in some cases, multiobjective history matching provides faster and more-robust convergence than the single-objective approach. In multiobjective, objective components (usually groups of them) guide the algorithm to different areas of objective space that lead to a diverse set of optimal solutions. These algorithms are widely established and well-developed for problems with two or three objectives. Under an increasing number of objective components, such as in a reservoir model with multiple wells and production data, multiobjective-history-matching performance (convergence speed and match quality) can deteriorate. One effective approach is grouping objective components to reduce the number of objectives. However, the existing literature does not present sufficient information on appropriate grouping techniques and ways of combining objective components.
   We present a novel technique to group the objective components depending on analysis of the nonparametric-conflict information obtained from a set with a limited number of initial solutions. By grouping the objectives depending on the conflict between them, we aim to achieve better performance in history matching. We apply this framework to history matching of an industry-standard reservoir model and a real-field case study. We also perform history-matching runs of groupings with different degree of conflict, and then analyze the performance among them with the statistical-significance test.
   Our extensive simulation results show that the proposed conflict-based strategy can be used as a guideline to help select a grouping of the objective components in multiobjective history matching optimally. By calculating the conflict between objectives a priori, we can identify which grouping scheme will result in a better performance. This technique can significantly improve the fitness quality of the matched model given the same number of flow simulations, and can also obtain a diverse set of models.

AB A systematic strategy for retrofit of the multi-period heat exchanger network (HEN) on the basis of the multi-objective optimization is developed. In this three-stage procedure, a simplified multi-objective optimization model of the multi-period HEN is first established and then solved to target the retrofit, aiming to minimizing the total annual cost and total annual CO2 emissions. The obtained Pareto front represents series of retrofit targets under different emission limitations, from which the most desirable one can be selected. The matching of the existing and the required heat exchangers is further implemented to finalize the retrofit, which will meet the practical retrofit requirements and matching restrictions. The application of the proposed procedure is illustrated through a case study of a HEN in a vacuum gas oil hydro-treating unit.

AB This paper provides an optimization-based approach to assure the strict positive real (SPR) condition in a set of recursive parameter adaptation algorithms (PAA). The developed algorithms and tools enable a multiobjective formulation of the SPR problem, creating new controls of the stability and parameter convergence in PAAs. In addition to assuring the SPR condition for global stability in PAAs, we provide an algorithmic solution for uniform convergence under performance constraints in PAAs. Several new aspects of parameter convergence were observed with the adoption of the algorithm in a narrow-band identification problem. The proposed algorithm is verified in simulation and experiments on a precision motion control platform in advanced manufacturing.

AB Although structural topology optimization, as a discrete optimization problem, has been successfully solved several times in the literature using evolutionary algorithms (EAs), the two key difficulties lie in generating geometrically feasible structures and handling a high computation time. These two challenges are addressed in this paper by adopting triangular representation for two-dimensional continuum structures, related crossover and mutation operators, and by performing computations in parallel on the graphics processing unit (GPU). Two case studies are solved on the GPU that show 5 x of speedup over CPU implementation. The parametric study on the population size of EA shows that the approximate Pareto-optimal solutions can be evolved using a small population with the proposed EA operators. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB One-way quantum computation (1WQC) is a model of universal quantum computations in which a specific highly entangled state called a cluster state allows for quantum computation by single-qubit measurements. The needed computations in this model are organized as measurement patterns. The traditional approach to obtain a measurement pattern is by translating a quantum circuit that solely consists of CZ and J(alpha) gates into the corresponding measurement patterns and then performing some optimizations by using techniques proposed for the 1WQC model. However, in these cases, the input of the problem is a quantum circuit, not an arbitrary unitary matrix. Therefore, in this article, we focus on the first phase-that is, decomposing a unitary matrix into CZ and J(alpha) gates. Two well-known quantum circuit synthesis methods, namely cosine-sine decomposition and quantum Shannon decomposition are considered and then adapted for a library of gates containing CZ and J(alpha), equipped with optimizations. By exploring the solution space of the combinations of these two methods in a bottom-up approach of dynamic programming, a multiobjective quantum circuit synthesis method is proposed that generates a set of quantum circuits. This approach attempts to simultaneously improve the measurement pattern cost metrics after the translation from this set of quantum circuits.

AB This paper presents a framework for optimization of site investigation program, within which the robustness of the site investigation program and the investigation effort are optimized. A site investigation program is judged robust if the derived statistics of the geotechnical property of interest are robust against the uncertainties caused by limited data availability and test error. In this study, a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation-based Bayesian inference approach was used to characterize the statistics of the intended geotechnical property. The robustness of the site investigation program was formulated as a byproduct of the Bayesian inference of the geotechnical property statistics. The proposed framework for optimization of the site investigation program was implemented as a bi-objective optimization problem that considers both robustness and investigation effort. The concepts of Pareto Front and knee point were employed to aid in making an informed decision regarding selection of site investigation program. The effectiveness and significance of the proposed framework were demonstrated through a simulation study.

AB The reliability-based robust geotechnical design (RGD) approach provides an effective tool to deal with the uncertainty in the estimated statistics of geotechnical parameters in a reliability-based design. However, the existing reliability-based RGD approach is not straightforward to apply as it involves multiple concepts. In this paper, the applicability of the existing reliability-based RGD approach is improved by utilizing Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). Here, an MCS-based weighted technique is used to evaluate the failure probability of a geotechnical system. With the aid of this weighted technique, the variation in the failure probability, caused by the uncertainty in the estimated statistics of geotechnical parameters, is computed using MCS. To further improve the efficiency of the RGD method, a series of single-objective optimizations are used in lieu of a multi-objective optimization in the robust design optimization process. The proposed MCS-based RGD approach is illustrated through an example of rock slope design. Compared with the existing reliability-based RGD approach, the MCS-based RGD approach is not only more intuitive and easier to follow, but also more computationally efficient.

AB The surrogate-based simulation-optimization techniques are frequently used for optimal groundwater re mediation design. When this technique is used, surrogate errors caused by surrogate-modeling uncertainty may lead to generation of infeasible designs. In this paper, a conservative strategy that pushes the optimal design into the feasible region was used to address surrogate-modeling uncertainty. In addition, chance-constrained programming (CCP) was adopted to compare with the conservative strategy in addressing this uncertainty. Three methods, multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP), Kriging (KRG) and support vector regression (SVR), were used to construct surrogate models fora time-consuming multi-phase flow model. To improve the performance of the surrogate model, ensemble surrogates were constructed based on combinations of different stand-alone surrogate models. The results show that: (1) the surrogate-modeling uncertainty was successfully addressed by the conservative strategy, which means that this method is promising for addressing surrogate-modeling uncertainty. (2) The ensemble surrogate model that combines MGGP with KRG showed the most favorable performance, which indicates that this ensemble surrogate can utilize both stand-alone surrogate models to improve the performance of the surrogate model.
